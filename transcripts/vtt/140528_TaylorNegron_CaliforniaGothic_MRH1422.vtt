00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
was born in Los Angeles. In a

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
house in a canyon,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that was in a nest of palm trees

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that casted these thin, unmoving shadows

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like prison bars.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was very California Gothic.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I am very California Gothic. I am

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the child

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of those people that you used to see in the ads for cigarettes in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the back of Life magazine. Those

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
handsome people that were always wearing

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
terry cloth robes and penny loafers, smoking cigarettes, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
looking like they just heard the funniest joke of their

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
life. The Marlboro Man

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
met the Virginia Slims woman and had

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
me.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's very California Gothic to have your best friend's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
mother who is a movie star keep her cracked Oscar in

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the kitchen next to the salt and the cumin and the Coumadin.  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(laughter)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's very California Gothic to see Joan Didion crying at the wheel of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
her green Jaguar on ?Moore?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Park below

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Ventura. It's very California Gothic to have a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
cousin who is a rock star. My cousin is Chuck

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Negron, the lead singer for the group Three Dog

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Night. And he bore a startling resemblance

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to Charles

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Manson. Now, when

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you were a kid like me in 1970, growing up in Los Angeles, you

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
knew that you shared the city with Charles

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Manson and his

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
family, because that grisly murderous night of mayhem

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and Helter Skelter was all anybody could talk

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
about. And for those of you who are too young to know what Helter Skelter is,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it's kind of like twerking -- but with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
blood.  And it was really

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
scary. Really horrifying.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And, and my

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
parents -- they were always going out on the town. They were always

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
getting dressed up and leaving like in Mad Men, right? They

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
just left me alone, they just went

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
out.  One night my father came in and he 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
said, "I want you to close all these doors and windows. I don't want

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
these hippies to come in here and de-gut you."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(laughter)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You heard him.  That was an option, in

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
my childhood, to be de-gutted.  

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it left a tremendous psychic

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
scar on my life.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It has stayed with me forever and I'm still very disturbed by

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
hippies and longhairs

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and headbands and large candles and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
beads and bandanas. I just don't like any

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
of it. But, um, 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I was only twelve years old.  I was a tween, I was a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
changeling. I was changing into a man.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But childhood is a place where your fears

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
are disproportionate. They're huge.  But then so are

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
your goals.  And, and that's where the magic can happen, in

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
these goals. And my goal when I was a child was to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
own a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
gorilla.  Or, you know

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
a monkey or an ape.  Anything from the monkey, ape, gorilla family. I just wanted someone to, uh, 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you know, be able to play hide and go

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
seek with. Swim,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
shoot

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000
dice, light ironing.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And my parents were these really emphatic kind of ghetto people from New York City, right, who

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
didn't like animals at all.  And my mother

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
said, "Look.  You will

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000
never, ever see a monkey walk through that

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
door."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But something very magical happened

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Christmas of 1970.  You see, my uncle Ishmael -- that was his real name,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Ishmael. He was a trucker and he

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
had his own flatbed truck.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Which meant that he could follow other people around who had flat bed trucks and pick up what

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
fell off of theirs.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
one day, he was closing down this raggedy-ass Circus Vargas in the Hollywood Bowl parking

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
lot on the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Highland, and he came across a monkey that somebody was throwing out.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
A live monkey,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
named Carroll. To Rs two Ls.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And we knew it was called Carroll because it had its own cage with its name on

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
it and that is what changed the deal with my parents because they

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
are emphatic New Yorkers, so they

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
said, "Well, if it's 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
free . . . and it comes

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
with a cage, what harm can it do?"

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Well.  Carroll came

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to the house. I was so excited. Carroll arrived on that flatbed truck on a pile

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
of

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
grapefruits, in his cage. And when I went out there and greeted him

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and I looked into those big round eyes, I knew that that I would understand

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
everything that monkey had to say to me. And that I would

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
experience

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
unconditional love. Well. The monkey promptly 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
squatted, s##t into its hand, and then threw it into my eye.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Under-paw.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(laughter)

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
(laughter)

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And from the shadow, I heard the ice clink in my mom's drink.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(laughter)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And she said,  "That's your monkey."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(laughter)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I loved my monkey so much, and I stuck with my

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
monkey while everybody turned against my

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
monkey. Sometimes they even put a sheet over its cage. I stuck

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
with my monkey when my monkey

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
willfully and intentionally f###ed my grandmother's mink hat, and 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I took the blame.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:59.000
(laughter)

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:03.000
(laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Carroll

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
was my most cherished early Christmas present.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But Carroll was not the only unexpected visitor that

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
season.  One Christmas night, the Santa Ana

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
winds blew too hard against the glass in

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
cold frightening Los

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Angeles. I had fallen asleep into a deep Christmas sleep. And I

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
looked out the window and I saw a

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
van pull up in front of the house, turn off and just stop.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Nothing happened. For thirty minutes. Nothing happened.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And I thought to myself, this is

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
it. This is my nightmare, it's going to come true.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And I thought to myself well at least I made it to

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
twelve. Then

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I looked out and the door opened up and then finally this plume of 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
smoke rolled out and these hippies came out on 

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
wobbly feet, and started slinking up to the front of

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
house. As the cast of Woodstock

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
approached

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I felt vulnerable in my Charlie Brown sleeping T-shirt.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I waited for the physical and

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
emotional attack to

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
begin. There was a knock on the door.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And I heard my mother's voice, muffled -- I knew she was dead, throat

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
cut -- I had read the papers. But then

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I heard her say, "Grilled cheese sandwiches for everyone."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Why was my mother giving protein to a serial

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
killer? And then there was a blast as my father came into my room and

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
he said, "Your cousin Chuck is here.  Come

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
down." And I timidly followed my father down the stairs

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to see in the living room what appeared to be Mama Cass Elliot,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Jim

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Morrison, and assorted longhairs devouring

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Christmas cookies. My cousin stood shyly holding a

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Three Dog Night album at the stereo, and he told us he was going to play a

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
song for us that no one had

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
ever heard before. Side One,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Song A.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog, was a good friend of mine

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I never understood a

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
single word he said but I helped him a-drink-a his wine."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And on that cold, windy night,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
everyone stood up and started to dance.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
My father grabbed my mother and they started to dance.  I

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
looked over and Jim Morrison -- "The" Jim Morrison -- was

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
dancing the jitterbug with my grandmother on the coffee

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
table. It was so

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
extraordinary.  It was so magnificent.  The hippies and the longhairs were all singing along

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
to choruses of "Joy to the world,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
All the boys and girls now . . . "

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And then, the song was over and someone picked up the needle and put it

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
back at the beginning. And the song continued, and the

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
dancing continued. And there's something

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
emblematic about certain California Christmas memories, and

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and here is one that is

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
transcendent, rock and roll.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And this is what made my monkey

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000
legendary. He came

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
down -- hurtling, down 

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
the stairs and went right up to the stereo, and started dancing.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(laughter)

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Had

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
we forgotten?  Carroll was

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
a circus monkey. And this was her cue.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
"You know, I love the ladies . . . "

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
His arms outstretched like rubber bands and he started picking off the ornaments on the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Christmas tree. "Love to have my fun . . . "

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The monkey started to juggle.  

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
"I'm a high night 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
rider, and a rainbow flyer, a

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000
straight shooting sun of a gun.  I said a

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
straight shooting . . . "   I wish you were all there

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to have seen the expression on those stoned -- 

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
we found out

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
later, on

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
L.S.D. -- hippies and my grandmother, as

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Carroll, my monkey, rightfully claimed the spotlight.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
"Glee" is a very good word to use, because that's what it was.  Pure happiness

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and glee, because I was twelve years old and I was

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
alive.  And I had escaped Manson's

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000
knife. And I had a monkey with

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
talent.  And as

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
everybody

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
danced, and as everybody laughed, and as everybody ate cookies, I looked at my family,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I looked at these people,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and all of their crimes -- 

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
past, present and future -- seemed to just spill out and dissolve into

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
the contours of the blue shag rug,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and as Carroll balanced an ashtray

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
on his nose, it was as though I was looking into my future.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Because I

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
realized all the glorious things that could happen

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
with music. And with joy. And that Christmas,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the last one that I was ever a child, I learned a very important

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
lesson that I'd like to pass on to you all tonight. And that's that no

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
matter how

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
horrible your day is and no matter how scary your night is,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
everything

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
can turn on a dime, and with a

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
knock on the door.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Thank you.
