00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In August of two thousand and one. Me and my boyfriend of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
six years. My first love of my life went through one of the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
worst break-ups in the history of recorded man. And I know that may sound naive

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
self-absorbed. And that's because it is. But I swear it was really

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
really bad. We worked together at the same company. But

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that's not where we met. We'd met in college when we were both like eighteen, nineteen years

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
old and when we met I was this like, super super

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
nerdy virgin.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I know it's hard to imagine but I was really a nerd I was really a virgin.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And he was sort of this chubby, like, almost virgin. You know what I mean? Like

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
he had a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
really fat face and, uhm, and he had slept with someone, but it was like

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
really should have been, was like he maybe stuck it into someone like an inch.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You know what I mean? But, for all intents and purposes, anyway. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So we both had really low self-esteem. And that was sort of part of what brought us together, you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
know, it's like "I feel crappy about myself.""So do I! Do want to come over and have sex?"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So that was like a part of the thing, but then the magical thing that happened was

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
was we got in this relationship. We loved each other and we showered each other with affection and sex and love. And over time

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we started to feel better about ourselves, you know, so like at the end of the six years we

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
were

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
both feeling OK and we were both sort of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
secretly independently wondering what it would be like, to sort of like, give having

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
sex with someone else a go. You know what I mean? And that's where the relationship began to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
crumble and even though we still loved each other, we ended up breaking up and he asked me to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
move out of our shared house.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I was devastated. But it was the sort of devastated where

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you think you feel bad but something's going to happen that's going to make you feel worse.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And for me that was finding out that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
like three weeks after I moved out, he started sleeping with his

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
twenty-two year old blonde assistant at the same company we worked at. She sat like five

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
feet away from me.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Yeah. What a fucker, right? She... 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I was... I am a normally level-headed human being. I went fucking ape-shit.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I went berserker. I didn't know how to handle this. It was the worst thing that had ever

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
happened to me in my life.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Like, it was a month, ?parr with? six years is the worst thing. And the w- w-

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
what made it even worse, is, she was absolutely like a Jewish's girls, like,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
like worst

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
shiksa nightmare. Do you know what I mean? She was ,like, blonde, she was petite, she

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was waify, she had a pert nose and, like, no visible body hair. It was just, like, the worst thing. So as a jew

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I hated her for being everything that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I wasn't. But then the worst fucking thing was that someone who was in the know

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
told me that she was also a Jew.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I was like, oh my God! I was like how could like a member of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
my own tribe betray me this way?! And the worst thing was that now

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
there was like the potential for her to actually be, like, neurotic and interesting. You know what

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I mean? And I couldn't just imagine her as this sort of like

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
emotionless WASP. You know, which is what I'd been thinking to make myself feel better. And I know

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that it's like wrong to ethnically

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
stereotype people. But I feel like if you already hate them for really valid reasons already,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it's OK. It's alright. Right? So I just, I, I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
was having a break- a BREAKdown. Just a total

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
breakdown. But I was like, OK I'm a normal human being. I will take

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the route people can take to recover from this in the normal amount of time. So I tried going to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
therapy to talk it out. Didn't work. I tried going to the gym to work it out- 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that didn't work. Instead I fell into this depressive

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
fucking spiral where I couldn't think about anything. I was just ruled by

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
these two horrible urges. One was the urge to just sort of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
masochistically think about how much prettier she was than me, and everything about her that was

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
- I don't know, just so much more perfect and sexier and better.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The other urge was that I needed to find out anything- something about her- something about her

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
personality that would allow me to hate her. That would allow me to feel superior to her like some, like, bit

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of dirt on her that would prove she was actually... shitty.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That wasn't what I had planned to say, but it's really what was here, ha, um. So one day,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I'm whining on the phone to my friend, Wendy. God bless Wendy. And I'm like "Hey, 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
[mumble mumble]. And uh, I wanted to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
hate her. "I wanna hate her, what can I find out to make her hate-able?" And she was like "Well, have you

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
tried Googling her?" Now,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I was a nerd but I was not a geek. So I didn't know what Google was.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I didn't know and I'm sure- right, you all know what it is?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
If there's one or two people here I'll explain it. Google is the most powerful thing ever

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
invented on the planet.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It is this fucking insane search engine that allows you to be crazy

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and stalk someone from the comfort of your own fucking home. Right?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It is a more important invention than fire or the wheel, as

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
far as I'm concerned. So she was like "Why don't you google her?"And I was like, "Shyeahh"

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I'm going to google the crap out of

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
this girl. 'Cause I knew her

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
name!  So I went to the little search window and I entered her name. I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
won't say her name here but needless to say, it was Slutskank.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So I google her, and I didn't understand the power of Google so I wasn't

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
really expecting anything to happen. But within three seconds, this link comes up and it takes me to

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
this , um, article that had been an interview with her from her college

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
newspaper freshman

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
year. And it was, like, this thing where she was like the "campus celebrity of the day." And I

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
was like- that's retarded. Um, so hopefully that would prove that she

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
too was retarded. But that's not what fucking happened. Listen to this.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So, um, the thing comes up. There's a photo of her. And it's

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the most adorable photo of a human-being ever taken. She couldn't look blonder or

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
more ?WASPy? Jewish. She's, like, wearing low-rider sweat pants before anyone

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
even knew about those. And like a thing with a cow on it and she's just in the three corners

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
great- UHH! And that drove me nuts. And I was scared to move on to the article

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but I did. It was an interview and in the interview she revealed that her

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
greatest desire/ goal in life was to become a stand-up comic. A famous stand-up

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
comic. I was like, fuck me.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Because that's- that was MY secret goal. That was MY goal.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And I'd always wanted to do

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that since I was a kid but I'd never had the guts, I'd never had the ?moxie? to do it. And here it was, I was reading

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
she was already in a sketch group, oh my God, I was like, so OK

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
she's... she LOOKS

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
?WASPy? but she's

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Jewish. She's banging my boyfriend. And she's already like apparently on her way to like

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
achieving MY dream. This cannot stand. Um, and I

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
decided

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
if we were both like aiming for the moon, right, and both had the same goal- this is going to be a

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
fucking space-race, right? And if it kills me, I'm going to be John Fucking Glenn.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm getting there first, right. So I start to

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
perform. The ironic thing, I've never been more miserable in my life. And I start trying to write jokes and

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
go perform. I'm going to open mic's and its depressing. And I hate it. But over time it's like

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
slowly improving. I get to do book-shows. ?So I go to? like two or three depressing open mic's,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
or four or five, like, OK shows a

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
week. But all along, I'm still just like manically depressed

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
right. And I'm like Googling her endlessly. And looking at the picture and that

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
picture became the focal point not only of my loathing for her but my loathing for myself

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and I literally, like five or six times a day, would just stare at the photo. I felt terrible about myself and

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
my therapist was like "If you don't stop Googling her, I'm going to call

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
your doctor and put you on Prozac." And I didn't want to go on Prozac because I was scared that one

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
side effects of Prozac would be that I would become less witty. And being witty was sort of the only

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000
side effect of being depressed that was working for me. You know what I

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
mean? So, haha, 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
you really should not clap, but so I was like "FUCK" so I decided to

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
keep performing and I'm not going to go on Prozac. Yet.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So I'm performing. So one day I'm doing this show- it's like at a slightly better place than I usually do it- and I'm watching

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the audience stream in to you know, filling in before the show starts and who walks in but HER

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
She comes in- the show had been advertised in ?Time Out New York?, my name, it was very clear.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
She must've known I was going to be there. I was, like,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
what's fucking kind of weird drive-by shit is this? 'Cause she

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
sat in the FRONT fucking row and it was clear

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and I was like oh my God I

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
felt so terrible, I was looking at her, and she was pretty, and- and-

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I barely could go on and it just so upset me. l managed to do it and I ran out as soon as I was done. I ran home 'cause I needed

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to have my nightly loathe-fest with the photo, right, and I'm sitting. I was just, like, how could she do it?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I'm about to google her and all of a sudden it occurs to me- maybe the reason she came there is because she's also

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
obsessed with me, like,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I am the girl before! She's dating this guy I was with for six years so she must be

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
curious- it must be driving her crazy! And I was like *Gasp* "What if she's Googling ME?'

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And I don't know 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
why it had never occurred to me to try Googling myself- I think that there was a rule against it or

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
something, or that the computer would, like, implode. Like- like- the

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
self-absorption wouldn't be handled. But I was like, I'm going to do it. I type my

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
name in- I 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Google MYSELF. And to my shock and amazement, there's like shit there

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
on the computer- about me! I didn't put it

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
there. And it's all stuff about performing. It's all like links to advertising for shows I had

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I had done- stuff that was like still there. One or two like kind of just really brief like nice

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
mentions about things in it. Like just sort of briefly made me feel better because it was like, OK 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
if this is the space-race, maybe fucking little Sputnik-bitch is not like as far ahead of me as

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I thought. But whatever, OK, so just like take a breath.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And it- but it did- It made me feel better and like, I realized it was the only antidote

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
,to like the shitty feelings I had when I would Google her, was to Google myself. And that's how I became obsessed with

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Googling myself

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And here's the thing about Googling yourself- it's as dirty as it sounds. You know what I mean?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It IS masturb- it just IS masturbating. There's no- like, you have this

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
urge to do it but you don't want anyone to know you're doing it. But the thing is, just like masturbating,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
people deny it but everyone does it. You know what I mean? But I would Google myself, I would look

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
at things, I would see if anything new was coming up, blah blah blah. So

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
anyway... I couldn't stop. I was Googling her and googling myself. Googling her and Googling myself.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Feeling bad, feeling good. OK.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So, one day I do a show at ?Irving? Plaza. It was like this big thing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Do the show. Next day. You know. Normal stuff. Come home, Google myself

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Wanna check-in, wanna check-in

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and umm.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Something new pops up and it's this thing, the heading, it's this link, it says "Funny Girl", I am like "What's this?"

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and, um, I click on it and it takes me to craigslist

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
list.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Yes? Do we know what Craigslist is? If anyone here doesn't  know

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It's like this hippie dippie bulletin board. People renting apartments and giving each other bikes and shit

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and, um, But there's this thing on a called

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Missed Connections. And that's a Funny Girl it's from and Missed Connections it's like that. You know

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
you know, on the back of the voice like when people see each on the street you're running down the street and you see someone cute or whatever.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And you don't have the guts to talk to them and then the next day you write something that's like, "hey I saw you on six avenue and

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
eight street. You're wearing a Metallica T-shirt... I like Metallica...ah, PLEASE CALL ME

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
You know. Like that! Billions of them! and that was "Funny Girl" was

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
adorable. I want to talk to you afterwards but didn't have the guts, you can email me 

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
can email me. This is the most amazing thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
life. I've never had someone just sort of like me without putting the work into it like

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
when I used to want to hook up with guys. I had it was like a huge exertion of personality

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
which was exhausting it's exhausting have a personality. 

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Fuck me so OK. So

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
no. So OK so I was like oh my god thats amazing.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So, damn you and your violin.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Hers

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
is OK So that was like incredible thing. And I

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
was overjoyed to talked to my friend Nick about that Iwas like should I email this guy? and he's "like Jesse he looked at

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the dates like that puts of the day if you did that show you the joke about he liked book I'd balls in your mouth

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and I like what your point. What is your point. He likes me he

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
really likes me. Anyway it's clear it's like a couple days to think about it

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
right in the space of those you days. I continued to give myself more shit

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
more to start popping up on Craigslist.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
About me. The second thing was from a totally different guy and it's like I saw

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
performing but this was kind of creepy it wasn't a brief and adorable it's like

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
little. And that's a real but yeah maybe the people on Craigslist the section on not dating material.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
But it could sort of be funny material for the stage because it's really the greatest website ever.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So I started doing this bit all around town about

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Craigslist and missed connections and I found that when I did it by saying it.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I was like inviting every like delinquent loon.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
To my little out that they would people would yield to to me.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And stuff kept popping up popping up what I didn't immediately know. Was that a lot of it was from my

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
fuckin friends because once I told him at the first two they're like Ha ha would it be funny like. Baker out.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Those like the decoys but I don't care. But if you looked on craigslist it look like I was hot

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
shit like a week and like

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
autumn. I was the truck shit. I'm almost sixty don't play again.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So. You're very good.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But one day.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I come it's like within the place special. To eat. I get back to my office from lunch. And I have a

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
voicemail on my phone from a man who identified himself as a

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
writer for the fucking New Yorker. And he says hello. He's like I've you know

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
this stuff about you on

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Craigslist. I would like to write a talk of the town

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
piece about you and like this crazy trend.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Please call me

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
a lot.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
What better a binge on ex-boyfriend and on the left gang. Than

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
for them to read an article in The New Yorker about the fact that I am hot. And I'm funny.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And I have fucking groupies.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
MY GOD OH MY FUCKING GOD and I was like I did. I call

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
of it

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
with don't feel it's like. I made it to the

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
moon first time to put the still down there bear with no one

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
writing about how you in the new word about what you're going to publication ever write. I've

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
never been this. I have no business. If I'm on the moon.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But then something happened which is that the article didn't happen.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Oh

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I should love. Pity. No it didn't happen to disagree.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I don't even

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
remember why it didn't happen. I'm really three

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Michigan. I don't know why it didn't happen. He was very nice and funny

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
comic put into its editor for some reason he couldn't get its through. I was really no. Eyes on the phone back

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
like it's OK don't worry OK fine hang up. But more disappointed

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
than ever been in my

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
life. And I started bawling bawling. Having a breakdown.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Bawling climbing. And during that ball. The house. I had

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
this like a piss knew where I left my body. Like my Tolson is like a can't take it I

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
left my body of floated up to the top of the often I look down and let's take a little land here.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm in my office. Right not done any work for my employer in about six months.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Lebed Dilling myself on the internet constantly. And I'm crying I'm crying and

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm disappointed but

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
why not because I didn't get the article in The New Yorker. But because

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
the ex-boyfriend and the bank wouldn't read

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
it. That's fucked up. Write him. And

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
it was like at that second. It all just

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
are like dawned on me that in the years since the breakup I've become so obsessed with

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
being this race. To make other people laugh. That I lost my ability to laugh at

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
myself as like if I could just Wrekin you ability to step back and look at

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
all the crazy thing is I've been doing since the thing happened.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I would be a better comic. Like to be material that's much funnier than anything I've

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
been trying to write and moreover I would be a happier person.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So that's what I did and I've become a better comic. And I've become a

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
happier person. And the other thing I decided was I really need to try to get laid.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I'm desperate. And I try to do that

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and after year kind of work and I've been dating

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
this guy that I really like and. I don't look at that girl's picture anymore.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
But he and I google each other constantly. Thank you very

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:50.000
much Lou.
