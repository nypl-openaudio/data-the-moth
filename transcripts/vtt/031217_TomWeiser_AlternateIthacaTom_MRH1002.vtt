00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
are

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some scientists who say that the universe that we inhabit is not the only universe 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
there is. There are alternate

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
universes. They say that these universes arise from the subatomic realm

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of quantum physics. Here's how they say it works. Every time a quantum event happens,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it produces all of its possible results. This is like saying if you flip a coin,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Since those two results are mutually exclusive, the flipping of the coin splits the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
universe into two alternate universes: the heads universe and the tails universe.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And since

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
quantum events are happening all the time, it means that alternate universes are bubbling up

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
continually. They're always being created, splitting off from ours. And these alternate universes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
are real. They're not just figments of the imagination. They're complete, whole, real

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
things. I know this is true because I experienced an alternate universe.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I was driving in my Volkswagen van

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
up to a tai chi camp in upstate New York a couple of summers ago.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I bought the Volkswagen van when I'd quit my job a few years previously. I bought

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the van because I quit the job as a custom database application

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
engineer. This was not a job that I really had intended to become. When I was a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
kid, that's not what I thought I was going to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
be. It's just sort of the job I happened into, and I always thought of it as

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the work I was doing before I was going to find my real

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
work. But when I got close to about forty, I suddenly thought, oh my God.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This could be it. This could be what I end up doing. This could be on my tombstone.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Tom Weiser. Custom database application engineer. Wrote

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
well-optimized queries.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Many

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
customers satisfied. And I thought, no, that can't be it. That cant 't all there is. And

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I quit the job without really knowing what I was going to do next.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set and to make a

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
lateral move to a career path that was more appropriate,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but I I really didn't want to do that. I didn't want to be so logical. I actually wanted something

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
more magic. I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that trades the cow for the magic

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
beans. And I know that that's a bad deal. I know

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that the cow's a better investment.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The cow's going to pay off in the long term but, but, but, but if the magic beans work out,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
you're in a whole new story, so. So I quit the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
job and I bought a Volkswagen Pop Top Camper van. And I drove

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
around the country, and what I thought was, OK.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm not going to make a lateral move. I am going to just drive around the country. And I'm gonna open

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
myself up to whatever may come. And then what I'm going to do is going to arise organically.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm gonna find my next pad there by the side of the road in Arizona. I'm going to pick it up and bring it back to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
New York.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So I drove around the country. Twenty-five thousand miles. Eight months. And when I got

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
back to New York,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I had no clue. I really didn't know, and it left me

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
very

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
vulnerable to the New York question. The first question anybody asks, which

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is, "So, what do you do?" I didn't know.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I didn't know, I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed because everybody knows

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
what they do. Everybody does, and I thought I should too.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to tai chi camp the other summer, I felt

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
very relieved because in camp, I know what I do.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I do the camp thing. I do what's at camp, and I don't know if you know this, but there are a lot of camps

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
for adults that are out there. I found them when I was driving around the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
country. There are tai chi camps and yoga camps and and birdwatching camps.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor and joust.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
All the things that give us joy and that we tend to demean with the name hobby.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Those are the things that are, that are celebrated in

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
camp. And when people go to camp, they are so lit up. They are finally getting to do

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that thing, the thing they love. It's like, yes.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I finally get to joust. I don't have time for that anymore. Really.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it. Now I decided on the way, I would

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
stop into Ithaca. I'd heard that it was a kind of a neat town. So I pulled off the highway into

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Ithaca,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and it's on the southern shore of Lake Cayuga. There's flat land and then

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
these hills, and it has a very particular microclimate there, which allows hippies

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to survive. All the stores have names like It Takes a

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Village or Hemp Unlimited.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And the, and the children are all completely multi-ethnic, and only wear cloth organic diapers.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It was really something. I drove around like sort of like Disney Hippieland, just watching it, And then I drove up

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the hill, up toward Cornell,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which has these stately buildings on the hilltop. And as I drove onto the campus,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I had this standing sensation, and I suddenly was pierced with a vision of an alternate universe.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
My alternate

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
life. I thought, oh my God. I was supposed to go to

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Cornell.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
If I'd gone to Cornell I would have studied animal behavior. And right now, I'd be

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
a professor of evolutionary biology. I'm a professor of

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
evolutionary biology and I've got a wife.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
She's got dark hair. She's really smart. And I'm a professor with a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
wife, and we've got two kids. They like to sing. It

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
was this completely realized vision of this alternate life, and it looked so

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
good. Alternate Ithaca Tom, he'd made these great choices.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It was really working out. And I drove around in a kind of

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
a wash of nostalgia for this life I hadn't had. It was like,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
wow, there's the Human Ecology Center. I did all my grad work there.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And there was this funky cottage that I used

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to live in where I had six roommates, and we had a chore wheel and ate brown rice.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And there was

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
these gorges that we used to do drum circles in and songs to the Goddess, and it was...

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And there was this woman that looked just like my wife would have looked when I would have met her.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I was overwhelmed by it. I couldn't stand to stay there any longer. I drove off the

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
campus. I fled Ithaca and flew to tai chi camp. But alternate

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Ithaca Tom came with me. Now, at camps, I tend to really have a

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
good time. I laugh a lot, I joke a lot,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
especially in tai chi camp, where the residents are kind of serious and slow-moving.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I can't help but kind of tease them. And in

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
this particular camp, the teacher said that we were going to be meditating

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
every morning from seven to

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
eight. And she was looking for a volunteer. Someone, a musician, that

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
would wander the hallways playing an instrument or singing to wake up the residents.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I'm not a morning person. And so I thought, oh. So I have a choice here. Either it's

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
going to be 6:30, I'll be lying in my bed really grumpy while some asshole

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
sings outside my

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
door, or I could be the singing

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
asshole.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
For the rest of that week, I was the singing asshole of the camp. Every morning, I would I would roam the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
halls, singing lustily, waking up all my

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
fellow tai chi players. And the the people there saw me laughing

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and singing, and they said, "Tom, it's really great to have you here. You're so happy. You're such a happy guy." And I thought,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and I thought 'Yeah, you think I'm happy, but you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom. I've seen him.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
He's

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
happy'. And the fact that he was so much happier than me was making me miserable.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I kept looking at everybody else's life and comparing myself to them. And I remember having

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
lunch with a woman who was in her 60s, and she was a calligrapher. And she was about to have her

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
first grandchild. She was really excited, and I

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
thought, maybe calligraphy. That could be it. And

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
then there was this other guy, and he had studied tai chi when he was in his 20s, and now he was a sales rep at Dell.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And I

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
thought, damnit, if I had studied tai chi in my 20s, maybe I could be a sales rep at Dell now.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I've never wanted to be a sales rep, but I was just getting carried away. That feeling that I was

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
in the wrong life, I was is in the wrong place. I couldn't shake it. I really tried

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to absorb the lesson of tai chi, which is to be present, just relax.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Accept what's coming to you and be present here. But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy. It's so much

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
easier to accept where you are, if only you're in the right place.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Eventually camp was over and I left. I drove back to New York. And as I was driving

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
over the George Washington Bridge I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom. He was hanging around me,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
haunting me like a ghost. And I thought, oh God. I need professional

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
help. So I made an appointment with the family psychic.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
is the guy that's done readings for all of my siblings and my cousins. And I went to see him, and he's

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
an astrologer, so he did out my chart. And this time, he was very interested

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
in this polarity that he saw. He said, "You have Saturn in the mid-heaven. And

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
this marks you as a person who could be very organizational. The organizational man,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the hierarchical one.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The corporate guy, the dad, the provider. Not particularly sexy, but a straight up

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
guy. On the other hand, there's Pisces in the sun, and they're

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
squared with each other. You can't resolve them. Piscean, the dreamer, the mystic. The guy that's

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the artist, never quite pinned down, never quite in a

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
relationship. And you have to balance these two. You have to choose one or the other."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And normally, I love to hear this kind of thing. This is the great thing about going to a psychic, is

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that for an hour, they just talk about me.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's so interesting.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But this time, I was so caught up with alternate Ithaca Tom, I couldn't really appreciate it

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
all, so I just blurted out what had happened to me. And I asked

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
him, "What does this mean?" And the psychic said, "Well, this represents

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
a fundamental choice that you've made in your life. You could have been the

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
hierarchical guy. But you chose to be the Piscean. If you had

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
decided to be an academic, you would have been very successful.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
There's no doubt that the university structure would have raised you up. You probably would be married, have

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
kids." I thought, "Oh, shit. Alternate Ithaca Tom made the right

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
choices." "But ", the psychic said, "if you had become an academic your wife would have

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
had an affair with your brother or your best

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
friend."

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Alternate Ithaca Tom is crushed.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
He's just found out that his wife is having an affair with his research partner. This is the guy's been working with for

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
15 years. It's a long-term affair. They're moving in together. She's taking the

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
kids. He's completely crushed, poor alternate Ithaca Tom. He starts drinking.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
He can't keep his lecture notes together. He can't keep his research together. He's coming up for tenure and it's all

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
falling apart. And in the midst

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
of his turmoil, he's suddenly pierced by this vision of himself

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
driving a Volkswagen

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
van. He's off to camp, to tai

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
chi camp. He's

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
not married. He doesn't have kids. He doesn't even have a job.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
He's completely free. It looks so good, this image. It pierces him to

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
his heart, begins to hang

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:47.000
around him and haunt him like a hungry ghost.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Louis.
