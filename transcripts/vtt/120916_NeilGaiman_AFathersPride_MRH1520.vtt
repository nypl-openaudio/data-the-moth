00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Applause]

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I didn't actually expect to be in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Asheville for the first time in my life

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
until three weeks from now

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when my son is getting married

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
here. [Applause]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
[Applause]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thank you. He's marrying a ?Nashville? girl. [Applause]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Applause] And it was

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because of my son, whose name is Mike, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or Michael. Or Mikey. Depending on

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
what time period we're talking about.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It was because of him that I discovered what an

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
incredible disappointment I had been to my father.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
was almost entirely the fault of the Mighty

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Ducks. [Laughter]

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because shortly after we moved to America, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to the frozen Midwest, um, 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Mike, was Mikey then, um, went to see the Mikey- Mighty

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Mighty Ducks and came back saying, "I have to play hockey. I have to do this." 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I have to play hockey, I have to do this, I'm gonna do this. And he did.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He learned to play hockey, he learned to ice skate. Next thing

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
you know, I was a hockey

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
dad. [Laughter]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I was

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a good hockey dad in that I could drive him to hockey. And I could

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
stand in a cold

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
shed. After that I kind of failed

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as a hockey dad.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I was never quite sure what was happening.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Um, he actually asked me, after my first attempt to cheer him on, to either stop 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
cheering him

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
on, or to get the terminology

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
right. It wasn't a hockey

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
bat. I'm shouting, "Hit that flat thing,"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
was just wrong.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And I apologized and, and, was sort of silent after that, and was never quite sure what was happening but I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
would keep my eye on the score. And I would know which side was him and which side was the other team.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So at the end

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of the game I would be able to say, "Well you did

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
best, or, or, or congratulations

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
[Laughter]. And then, my father came out

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
from England to stay with us for a few days. And I took him

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
with. To a hockey match. And I got to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
see the joy. In my dad's face. Watching

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
his grandson. Part of his genetic line. Play

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a sport. [Laughter]

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
play well and take pride in this and, I saw

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
this amazing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
amazing joy and delight in my dad's eyes I'd

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
never ever seen. I was,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the other kind of kid.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Um, in, in sort of, Junior School where you get two team captains. And they get to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
pick the kids that they wanted to play with them, and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
they pick backwards and forwards. They would eventually get

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
down

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to a very short girl with very thick glasses and a leg brace

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
me. [Laughter]

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And then they'd pick her. [Laughter]

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I did not have what it took to play sports. I had

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
a different kind of head. And it wasn't that I didn't want to be good at sports, I would

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
have loved to have been good at sports. Um. I would go out onto

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that football field, or the rugby

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
field, or whatever the kind of field it was, with every intention

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of making everybody proud of me and they would tell me where to go and stand I would go and stand there and I'd watch

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that ball go. And I'd think you know, that ball it's a lot like those

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
adverts in the back of those American comics

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
for, baseballs that you can throw and they, they go in all sorts of weird

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
directions, and

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that's really cool

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and, you know that, that's not quite as cool

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
though as those x-ray spectacles that they advertise, 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
where you can not only look at your hand and see the bones, but you can

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
also see naked ladies! [laughter]

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
it's one dollar ninety-nine, and the Americans have to be so far ahead of

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
us

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
technologically. [Laughter]

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And they have sea monkeys. And I don't know what

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
they are but they're monkeys, and they live under the water. And somehow,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the older male sea monkeys can smoke pipes.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
- underwater, and I wonder

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
how you smoke a pipe underwater, and just as I'm pondering

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the various ways you could smoke a pipe underwater, something very large and heavy and wet and made

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of leather is gonna hit me in the side of the face. And then I'm gonna look 'round and people are going

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to be shouting at me because apparently I should have known this was going to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
happen and done something about it

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and... That was how I played sports.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.000
What

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I did was make things up.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It was all I really wanted to do. Um,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
my dad found this rather hard to understand that I had no wish to follow him in into

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
any of the family businesses that he wanted to be in or he was in, I, I,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
didn't have that. I didn't want to be in property.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I told him I wanted to write. So he tried to get me a job

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
as somebody who showed people around a show

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
home. And I said, "that's not actually writing". And he said, "no, no, no, 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
"No, no, no. There's a lot of time when people won't be visiting the show home, so you can just sit there and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
write."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And to please him I actually went for an interview, but the man never showed up.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So I got on a bus and went home and that was the end of my attempt to ever get a real

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
job. [Laughter]

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I wrote, and my dad was great. He was really supportive

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
in the ways that he could be supportive when I, when I was a, a young

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
starving journalist with two

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
very small kids, he suggested that, um, probably the

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
best thing that he could do was he had a flat that he owned above a shop. And

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I could just stay. We could stay in that flat, and we

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
could cover the bills but we didn't actually have to pay rent, and that was great.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And eighteen months later, when I could afford to pay rent he said, "Right, now move out!"

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
"Go get a place." And I did. And it was great.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And time went

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
by and I started, to get more and

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
more successful. I started to win awards.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And people would say to my dad, "You must be so proud of him."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And he'd say, "I'm proud of all my children."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Until my little sister told him to stop saying that 'cause it was really irritating.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And I was proud too, Mike, grew up.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And he started doing computer things. And I discovered

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
whenever I'd ask him what it was that he actually did,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that it all went away. I'd say, What do you do? and he'd say, Well

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
what I'm doing right now is

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
?wah wah wah wah wah wah?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
?wah?." "I don't think I got that." And he said, "Well you understand, Python is a programming language."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
language," and,"I'd yes I've got that," and he'd say, "Well ?wah wah wah wah?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
?wah wah wah wah wah?."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And it was 2009, 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and I'd written a book called "Blueberry Girl." Which was

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
illustrated, and beautifully illustrated by Charles Vess.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And the last time I'd done a signing in New York, it had been a horror show.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It had been at Barnes and Noble Union Square. It had been at night.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Um, there was, we had to finish signing

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
for about a thousand people against the clock, and all I did was put my head down and I signed.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And I signed and we checked, and we were pleading with these people keep the store open and we finished, and the last person

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
went out and they locked the doors. And I swore I was never coming back. And now I was coming back, 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but I was coming back to a bookstore called Books of Wonder, a beautiful children's store,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and Charles Vess was there with me and the smartest thing we did

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
was we were gonna start at one o'clock in the afternoon. So we didn't have a curfew.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We were great. And I was in the taxi on the

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
way to the signing when my phone rang and

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I answered it, and it was my sister, my little sister, 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
calling from England to let me know that my dad had been in a business

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
meeting and he'd asked for a glass of water because he wasn't feeling very well.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And having never been sick for a day in his life, he was dead of a heart attack by

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the time he got to the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
hospital.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And I was numb. I had the taxi drop me off.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Actually in Union Square near that Barnes and Noble and I, I,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
phoned my children. Phoned a

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
few people and

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
then, my agent ?Marilee? who was with me said,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
"You could not do this, you know, everyone will understand." And I said no,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I, I actually really want to do this."And I walked

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
up to Books of Wonder. And Charles was there and Charles

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
showed them his beautiful paintings and I

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
read this poem that I'd written to an unborn daughter.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And then I signed for fifteen hundred

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
people - for 8 and a half hours.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And it was wonderful. All of these people were there and each person came up gave me something

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to do, and I didn't have to think about it, and I didn't have to worry.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And at the end, I was exhausted. And I

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
was done. And I was leaving 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Books

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
of

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Wonder and ?Marilee? said to me, "You know the last time I saw your father?"

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And I said, "No, when was the last time you saw my dad?" And she said, "Oh,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
"Oh, it was in that Barnes and Noble signing you did in Union 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Square," she said, "He came up there. And he was just standing on

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the side. He was in New York and he stood on the side and he watched you and

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I saw him and I recognised him and I went over and I said, 'Hello David.' And he said 'hello.'

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And I said 'You must be so proud of Neil,' and he said 'I really am.'

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And she said, "So I said to him, 'But you must have known this would happen.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
You must have known he's, he's such a brilliant writer. He's, he's wonderful. You must have

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
known this was gonna happen.' And my dad

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
looked at her and he said, 'No, he wanted to be a writer. I thought I was going to be supporting him his whole life.'

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
[laughter] And I

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
thought, you know for my dad, watching me signing at that Barnes

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and Noble was probably an awful lot like me

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
watching Mike play hockey.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
thought, but even so he was perfectly willing to support me my

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
entire life. Just as I would have been willing to support Mike.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And even though he was completely baffled, just as I had been

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
baffled, he watched, as I watched,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
with every bit as much love.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Applause]

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
[Applause]

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Applause]
