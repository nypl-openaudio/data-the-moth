00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Prisoners tell lies. Every corrections officer knows this. In fact there's even a joke about it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
How do you know when a prisoner is lying? When he opens his mouth.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I spent almost a year working as a state corrections officer or CO up at Sing Sing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I wasn't there for the same reason as my fellow officers who were there for

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
a paycheck. I was there to learn about the life and be able to write a book about it. But

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the inmates didn't know that and so they lied to me. The same as

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
anybody

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
else. For most of my time I worked in a place

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
called people B Block, it's a massive human warehouse with almost six hundred men in it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One of those men was an artist, a Latino guy named Sunny. About twenty five years old

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
slightly built. He had a giant set of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Felt tip markers.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And for the price of four packs of cigarettes another inmate could pay him to do

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a customized greeting card for any occasion. Easter - Mom

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I miss you,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Whatever. But it would say the name of mom. And it would have anything else personal you wanted in it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These things these works of art and they were, it took him two or three days

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to complete and I'd watch him admiringly and he was a friendly

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
guy and I got talking to him and one day I said Sonny what are you doing in here?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I had him pegged for some drug offense you know some, some massive sentence

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for a relatively small crime and he uh, he made a gun

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
out of his hand and he said, "Murder. Murder, C.O. - triple life".

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And I thought whoa, you? murder?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
About a month later

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the department put an inmate look up page on their website

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
so you could enter a person's name, and it helps if you have their number too, which

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I did. And when I did that for Sunny it came back "larceny".

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So Sunny was a burgler, a thief, he wasn't a murderer, but he was in a place

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
where you want everybody to think you're as tough as you could possibly be.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And being a murderer is a good thing in Sing Sing. And I understood why Sunny

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
had told me that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I had another inmate on the other side of that floor, was one of the very few white

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
guys on the floor. There are one hundred twelve inmates I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
supervise four of them were white. He was one, he was a middle aged guy, glasses,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
not much hair left, and constantly afraid of the other prisoners. You could just see him,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
he's always looking over his shoulder - he was afraid. And maybe that's one reason he

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was friendly to me.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I liked him OK, and one day I said hey VanNess  so what brings you here anyway?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And he looked sort of ashamed, he said "Attempted murder, CO.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Attempted murder. I tried to kill my business partner." And I said "I'm 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
sorry to hear that"

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And uh,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And I went home and I went home right away and I looked up VanNess

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and he was in for second degree sodomy, which means sexual intercourse with somebody

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
under thirteen years of age. And you can see why somebody like that would be afraid

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
In prison. And you can see why somebody like that would tell a lie.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The most common I suppose was the one you hear almost every day which is just - I didn't do it, CO,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that's not me. I'm doing, I'm doing somebody else's time this is a bum rap, I was

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
framed. You hear this every single day and first I was kind of interested and I thought

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
wow a travesty has occurred and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I want to know more, but it doesn't take long you just filter

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that out it. You just add it to the rest of the noise you deal with every day and uh...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And officers have a way, I have a response - they don't say this to the inmates, you don't want to stir things up, but,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the response we tell each other is yeah well. OK he didn't do that but you know he did something

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
else and, uh, it's

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
cynical. But you know most crimes go unsolved. And

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
when a person is sent to Sing Sing, when they are convicted of a crime, almost always

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
it's been more than one crime that got them there.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So it may be the officers are right, though that idea always

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
bothered me.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
There was one inmate I talked to even though I didn't like

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
him. His name was Wari Al-Habib. He was an older man,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'd say late fifty's, tall handsome. Wore a Kafia and other Muslim

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
garb and he loved to yell at the COs

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
He loved to get a good rant going and mine came one day when

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I asked him for his ID card. And he had no reason to dislike me but, BING

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
ID card? You mean transit pass don't you CO? You mean transit pass

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because this is South Africa. This is the apartheid system here. This is the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
white man oppressing the black man. This is a bantu stand. You heard, CO? You know you know that word means? I bet you don't, do you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Bantu stand CO, look it up.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And that's an unpleasant thing to hear. But

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I was interested because the only

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
other explanation was the COs explanation of why there was this terrible

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
terrible racial imbalance in prison. And the COs explanation doesn't even bear repeating. So

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
so I was interested in what Habib had to say.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Problem is I couldn't tell him so. Because any CO who admits to accepting an idea like

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that that, that the the system might be a little rigged, loses all credibility.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Not only among COs but among the prisoners.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
They don't want to hear that from you, you are there to...To stand up for the law

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and stand up for the system.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So I didn't say that to say to a Habib. But I did ask him other things. He got so much

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
respect from all these prisoners and I learned. One reason is he'd been in so

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
long. He had a bad a limp. He had a limp because he had a bullet in his butt

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
against his hip.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
He had the bullet there according to him because the state wouldn't pay to take it out. The bullet had come from

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
a state trooper during the Attica uprising in 1974 I think.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And, uh, Habib

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
was respected for that. If he wanted

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to shower and it wasn't his day for a shower the younger guys would say "Hey Conover give my shower to Habib, Habib can have my shower."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I'd say OK. And one day I said to Habib

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
"Habib, what are you here for?" And he said "Oh man, I'm locked up,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I'm locked up for rape, man."

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I said "What?"

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I believed..I thought...

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
First of all I thought he was telling me the truth but I couldn't understand all the respect he was getting if that was his crime,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because that's only

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
slightly higher on the scales and then VanNess' crime. So I was

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
intrigued by Habib. I was worried about him, but I was intrigued. I thought he

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
had a lot to

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
tell. And he left Sing Sing before I did. His arthritis got so bad he couldn't

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
climb the steps. There's a lot of steps there so he got sent to the geriatric unit

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
of another prison. Yes there are many geriatric units for prisoners

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
these days.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And when I quit. A few months later I thought, you know, all the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
people. All the interesting people I met in prison who I really didn't have a chance to talk to,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Habib is at the top of my list, so I went back to that inmate look up page. Habib is now at Green Haven 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
correctional facility. I wrote him a

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
letter he wrote me back, and two weeks later I'm sitting in the visiting room

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Of Green Haven. He's the only inmate I ever went to visit. And he is

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
so happy I'm there. Because I'm the first person who's visited him in more than

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
five

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
years. And. And I was happy too. I was happy.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
because I thought for once, one of the walls is down. I'm not wearing a uniform.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
He knows I'm interested in as a person. He's going to be candid with me. And the first thing I want to know

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
about this rape thing.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And it's the same rap I heard time after time at Sing Sing. 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
"I didn't do it Conover, it was a set up, I was...you know...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I'd been let out, I'd been paroled. I'd been free like two months and they're

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
looking for a con, they're looking for a time to lay this crime on.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And I was in my late fifty's when I got charged with that. I didn't do it. I got a good lawyer, though Conover. I got a good lawyer, she been trying to

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
get me out for years. She's going to get me out. I think it's going to happen real soon and

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I said OK Habib,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you've got a good lawyer I'm glad for that. Tell me what else, tell me what else you went to prison for and he had

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
a long story. It started early on. He ran numbers in Newark, he

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
was called Newark Red. Then he told me became a gangster, "I was a stick up man

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Conover". His

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
second. His second prison term was for robbery and assault.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And then he went in once for extortion.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
He converted to Islam during his third term. He said it wasn't until then I

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
came down off my high horse Conover. I learned, you know, there's

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
more important things in the world than me and Islam had been good for him, you could see it filled his life

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
with purpose and discipline. And uh...

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I liked hearing about all that. And he was glad to tell it, and he was glad I was there too because of all

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the vending machines around us. And in prison you

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
get kind of tired of the food and in the vending machines there's pies and sandwiches and

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I bought a lot of those for us and

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
we spent a pleasant afternoon that

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
way. I couldn't figure out how to work Habib into my book.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
He was such an interesting guy but,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you know, I didn't think he was telling me the whole story and I went on writing, I stopped thinking about him

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
until about four months later. It was a hot night in August.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I was lying on my bed. Almost midnight I was falling asleep I had New York One News on

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and uh

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and uh

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The announcer said something about another inmate

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
exonerated on DNA evidence.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Barry Shekh today got another inmate free on the basis of D.N.A. evidence. And I sat up and I looked,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And damn if it wasn't Habib coming out of Green Haven prison

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
with his lawyer Ms. Peel and Barry Scheck. And I said "Oh my God" and I woke up my wife.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And I said "Margaret, you're not going to believe this, but

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
this is the guy. This is the guy who said he was innocent and he was innocent!"

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And it shook

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
me up. I'm still shook up and uh...

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I couldn't sleep well that night. First thing next morning I call the guy I worked with who is now an NYPD officer

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and I said, "Terry, remember that guy Habib, he used to yell at us?" He said, "Oh yeah I remember."

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I said, "Remember he said he was innocent?" And he said "Well,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I suppose,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
everybody said that." and I said, uh, 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
"He was innocent. I just saw them on T.V. Barry Sheck just got him off."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And he said "That's interesting Conover. But you know if he didn't do that crime I bet

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
he did something else." And I thought oh man...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the problem. The problem that stuck with me was both that...in this occassion...maybe he did do something else

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
but he was doing time that wasn't his

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
To do. He did six years. He did six years that were, were not his crime.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.000
The

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
second thing that got me was I was part of his punishment. I was the guy who locked him in every day. And that bothered

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
me.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I moved to New York about fifteen years ago from Colorado. And I thought you know to make it in a city

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
like this you're going to have to be a little more tough, going to be a little more suspicious, going to have

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
watch out for yourself, going to have to question what people say. Be a little

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
less trusting, don't take things at face value.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And especially, well, Habib taught me this lesson.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I mean. Let me step

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
back. Especially in a place like prison, you have to be skeptical.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Because you hear, you hear untruths all day long. But the lesson Habib taught me 

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
was this - that if you don't question that reflex, if you

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
don't imagine now and then there's cotton in your ears and stop to listen to

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
somebody who is not listened to, you might just lose your ability to hear the truth when it comes

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:55.000
at you. So thanks. Thank you very

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:55.000
much.
