00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You know, I live in New York

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
City and New York City can be completely overwhelming.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So the other day I was feeling kind of stressed

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
out. And I decided that I was just going to forget about life for a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
while and go

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
downtown and get a piece of cake.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Do you guys ever have one of those days when it just seems like a piece of cake

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is going to make everything so much better?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I headed down to The Magnolia Bakery.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I'm standing there in line and I start to relax 'cause I think about this guy that I met

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
recently in the city. I didn't even know him, he just came right up to me in the street.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And he said, "I'd like to give you a piece of advice." And I said, "Sure."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Because, you know, I'm always up for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
good advice. And, uh, he said, "You look 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
really stressed out. You should pick three things you can do

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
really well. Every day.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then just let the rest go."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I thought that was fantastic advice for anyone living in any big city.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Pick three things you can do really well every day. And then let the rest go.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But I thought about it and I remembered.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That guy didn't have any

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000
teeth. [audience laughter]

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So I guess "Brush my teeth" didn't make his top 3 list 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
very often.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But I'm standing there in line at 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the bakery and I'm saying this mantra to myself that I made up,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that I say when I'm feeling kind of down. And I want to share it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
with you tonight. It goes like this.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You close your eyes. You take a deep

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
breath, and you say, "May I feel like I feel 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when I'm about to eat cake."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And you do! You think "cake!" like you might

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
get some, and you feel better! It works every single time.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And I'm standing there at

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the bakery and I'm almost to the counter, when my cell phone rings. It's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
my friend, Karen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
She's down south. She's just been dumped by her boyfriend. She

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
was dating a gay Elvis

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
impersonator. Now, I knew he was

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
gay, and so did everybody else. Only

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
she didn't. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And, you know, I- I realize it's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so strange how sometimes, we can fall in love with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
people, and we can barely even see them.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I thought that "impersonator" should have tipped her off a little

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
bit. But I could see the Elvis part would kind of throw

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
you. [audience laughter]

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And I said to her, "Karen, Karen, it's OK, it's OK, you know, it's gonna get better, and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
these things happen for a reason." But I realize how difficult that must be to hear

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
when the Elvis you thought you knew and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
loved turned out to be totally queer."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He left her a note on the pillow that said,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
"I've fallen in love with a man. I'm flying back to New

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
York. Thank you very much. Good night."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And I knew right then what I had to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
do: I had to go south. I had to see my friend.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So about a week later I booked a ticket to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Georgia and I flew south.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And when I got out of the plane,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
it just felt so good to get out of the city for a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
while, and I always have this kind of yen for the South anyway, because

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I keep having this recurring dream that I'm this beautiful

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
black woman down south and I'm sitting on my back porch

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
braiding my daughter's hair.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
We're

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
looking out, watching the fireflies fade into the dusk.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then I wake up. And I can't tell if that's, like, a past life,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Or if that's just every gay

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:55.000
man's fantasy.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But at the same time, I do believe there is a beautiful black woman down south.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
She's sitting on her back porch, braiding her daughter's hair. They're looking

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
out watching the fireflies fade into the dusk. And she leans over and

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
she says, "Honey, I keep having this strange

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
dream." [audience laughter]

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I'm a gay man, I'm living in New York City, I'm walking with

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
crutches.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I'm eating a piece of

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
cake. [audience laughter]

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Do you think that's real, or is that just every black woman's

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.000
fantasy?"

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So the plane touches down in Georgia. And I want to get

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
my friend Karen

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a gift. So I go into the airport, and go to the bookshop. And I walk straight to

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
the self-help section. Because that is the perfect place to start

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
post-gay-Elvis-impersonator

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
breakup.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I'm standing there looking through the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
books and I come across that book, "Heal Your Body" by Louise Hay.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And I'm flipping through it, looking up things like lower back pain and canker sores.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But then I look up cerebral palsy. And it's in there. And

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it says, "Cerebral Palsy:

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Brought to this earth To heal the family with one

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
sweeping gesture of love." Brought to this earth

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to heal the family with one sweeping gesture of love?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The words kind of glared off the Page at me and I threw the book

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
down and I thought, "You know, I don't really want that job!"

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I mean, I-I'm just trying to have a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
life. Fuck Louise Hay, man.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Fuck Louise Hay."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Which is a very useful mantra, by the way.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
[audience laughter] And I've

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
used it

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
many times since. And I don't mean to

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
imply that the people down south were in any way overly conservative. But I did notice

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that a lot of the books on Judaism were in the

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
occult section.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So I just decided to go. And when I got to my

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
friend Karen's house she was doing kind of bad and I said, "Come on. Let's go out. Let's go for a ride."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And we got in the car, and we drove for hours. And the amazing thing about

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
being down south

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
is that it seems like--to me, anyway--that if you drive just far enough,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
there aren't that many houses anymore. There's just these soft green rolling hills.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and the sun is shining. But there are these little churches. Everywhere.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And they have these marquees out front with the most amazing sayings on them.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And one of them said, "We love you. And there is nothing you can do

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.000
about it"

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[audience laughter] So we decided to check

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that out. [audience laughter] So we wa-

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So we

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
walked into the church and it was a Southern Baptist Televangelist church.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And when we walk in, cameras are on cranes, swinging around the room. And the minister is up

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
there preaching. How Christ is gonna come down and wipe the blood of

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the sinners from the seat of judgment.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And I didn't really understand him.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I just heard "spilling of the blood of sinners" as I was walking in. And I

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
was sure he was talking about me.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And we sat down in the front pew, the only place left

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
open. And right then, this woman and a couple of other men from the

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
church come up to me. And she says, "Can I ask you a question?"

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And I said, "Sure."

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And she said, "Are you

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
comfortable?" And I said, "Well,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
it's a little hot in

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
"here."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And she said, "No, are you comfortable living in that body?" "Yeah,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"You know what, I -"

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
know what, I am, so just move along.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.000
But

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
she and the other men took me to where the minister was preaching,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and he grabbed my head. And he said, "I want you to get the Devil out of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
your body, I want you to throw down those canes and walk, I want you to get the devil out of your body, I want you to throw down those canes and walk,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I want you to get the devil out of your body." And then, palm flat, smacked me in

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And then palm-flat, smacked me in the middle of the forehead. [laughter] But instead of 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But instead of falling over, I just sort of leaned back, and then I came

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
up again. And he actually seemed kind of mad.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Like I wasn't working with him. So

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
he knelt down on

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
his knees in front of me, and he starts rubbing my

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
legs. And he says, "I want you to get to the devil out of your legs, get the devil out of your legs," and

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
oh my God, guess what happened.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I got an erection.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[laughter]

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
[laughter]

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Which even for me is completely out of control.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And I'm looking down, thinking, "Well, I'm certainly going to go to Hell now."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And he's down there rubbing my legs, "Get the Devil out of your legs! Get the Devil out of your legs!"

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I'm thinking, "Sir, that's not where the Devil is

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:05.000
right now."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And you know, the

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
funny thing is, if I can actually put down these canes and stand on

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
my own and walk a

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
few steps. Not very far.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
But you guys. I don't know if it was the cameras or the 

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
pressure, but I just didn't know how to get out of it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I put down one cane.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And then I put down the other. And for just a second,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I stood up.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And the congregation starts

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
freaking out, and the minister looks at me, like, "Oh, my God!

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I actually did it."

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And you know, I always did sort of want to be on T.V.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I just never thought it would happen that way.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Which just goes to show, the Lord does indeed work in mysterious

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
ways. But you know, while it was happening,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
while I was in the middle of it, I wanted to

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
say "stop". Wait, I mean

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
"I'm OK. Who are you to decided that I need to be healed of this?"

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
of this? Did you make me less

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
neurotic? Can you get me a better job?  How about the perfect boyfriend?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But not this.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
This just isn't at the top of my

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
list."

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But I wasn't brave, and I didn't tell him.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And then for just a second I thought, "What if he really

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
did have the ability to heal people,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
somehow, it didn't happen.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Because I was the most cynical one in the room.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Right then my friend Karen comes up and she grabs me by the shoulder and she says, "Come

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
on, let's get out of here."

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And we get in the car, and we drive in silence for hours.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And we end up back in Athens, Georgia,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and we're sitting there at the Grit Restaurant.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And my friend Karen's across from me with her triple-layer white sponge

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
cake with chocolate frosting. And I have my German

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Chocolate cake. And as I sink my fork down through the layers, I

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
think, "This is what it's about." You

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
know? These are the moments where we find our faith

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the joy of the

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
anticipation of the moment. Because there will always

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
be fantasies about being someone else. And there will always be people who want

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to heal you,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So they can feel better.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And there will always be a gay Elvis impersonator

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
who will break your heart. So

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I sit back and I open wide. And I

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
say, "May I

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:30.000
feel like I feel when I'm about to eat cake."

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[applause]
