00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It was 10:30 on a Thursday night. And I was in my apartment

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I had just hung up the phone. I had been broken up with.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yet again. By one in a string of

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
many five foot seven, rogaine rubbing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Nintendo playing,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Beastie Boys listening, Hamptons

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
traipsing, New York

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
frankly. And I had had it. I really had it. And

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I had had it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because to tell you the truth, I didn't even really really

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
like any of these

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
guys. Looking back I didn't like any of them. But I wanted one thing from them.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Just one thing. I

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
wanted a boyfriend. Ladies and gentleman. When you're in your twenties

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and you're in New York and all your friends have bo- like having a boyfriend.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Gives you some legitimacy. You know, it gives and you can say 'Oh,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
have you met my

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
boyfriend.' It was like owning

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
property. This, this is my boyfriend.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
My boyfriend is taking me out for my birthday. My boyfriend is taking me

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
out for Valentine's. My boyfriend my boy, like a boyfriend.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the New York man. The New York didn't wanna, no one wants to commit.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You know they get the willies and they get all freaked out and I couldn't get someone to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
be. [Sound of cellphone] Maybe that's my boyfriend.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I, I couldn't get someone to be my boyfriend.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And so

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And so, I hung up the phone, and I was very depressed, and I decided I was going to go to an AA meeting.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I wasn't actually in AA. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I was in OA. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Overeaters Anonymous. But OA didn't have any meetings late at night. When I did the bulk of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
my problem eating. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
decided that I would

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And so I decided that I would go to an AA meeting. I had done this a lot. When you're lonesome

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you know. So anyway, I show up at the eleven o'clock 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
AA meeting over at Our Lady of pity.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
on uh, seventy ninth Street and you know I, I go over there and I head into the church basement.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Everyone is smoking. And I pull up a chair and I listen to some former prizefighters tale of woe.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He killed a man with his bare hands 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I dunno, you know the drill. And anyway I'm putting my coat on to leave 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and I feel a tug at my sleeve. And I turn around and there's this guy he's about my

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
height and uh he's in a floor length leather

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
jacket. And he's got you know those cowboy boots that were very big in like the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
early eighties with the metal tip. You know he's got that doin'. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And uh he had kind of a 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
weathered sort of a port of authority look to him. You know.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And he said to me in his, in this way he said, ah, "hey

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What's a nice girl like you doing in a dump like this?"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.000
[Laughter]

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
He didn't have cerebral palsy.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But he had like a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
palsied affect. You know.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
like a twitch. So uh. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
He asked me if I would like to go out for coffee and of course I accepted.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And we got to know each other. His name was Steve Rubenstein

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and he was thirty days off crack. And uh alright. Alright. That's a start.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And uh, he asked for my phone number and of course I provided it and he called me that night.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And he said "Dina I just want to say I think you're a really special

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
girl. And uh then he called me the next day 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and he asked me if I would have dinner with him the next day and I said absolutely. And he picked me up in a Mercedes Benz. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then the next day we went out for dinner again and he picked me up in a different Mercedes Benz.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And he, you know with a leather jacket 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
he said to me he said, "Deena, do you notice a difference between this Mercedes

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and the black one?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And I said No. And he said, this one purrs. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And I, I think of him saying that and I was repulsed. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I was repulsed by him. But I thought to myself, this could be the one.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
[Laughter]

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Like, here he was you know, calling, and. This could be the one. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Because you know something, he was thirty days off crack notwithstanding. Steve Rubenstein. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
First of all he was Jewish and at the time that was important to me. Various reasons.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But also

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Uh, but also Steve

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
called. 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Because when I got together with my friends for Chinese food and they all had boyfriends and they would say, "So, Dina, did he call?"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And, of course, I'd always say no. And then they'd have to give me that speech about how it's not you, 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you know. It's . . . something must have happened at work, he's busy with other things. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
No it is you. Like, it's you. You did, I did something to something

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
however small to annoy him, you know. I was sitting in the cab and I started singing,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
singing, (sings) ....wanna, I wanna, I wanna play. Like that is all it had to be

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And that was it. And you never heard from the person again. That was it. But Steve called.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Hello Deena,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
it's Steve.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Alright, fine - but he called!

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
[Laughter]

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now I had been able to keep Steve at bay sexually for about three weeks.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Because you know I was playing the recovery card. You know what I mean? 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Like look you know we're both going through changes. You're thirty days off the pipe, I have my food issues. 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Let's

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
just, you know. And he was buying into it. And everything was OK for about three weeks there. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But finally at the end 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of three weeks. You know it was time to pay the piper. He, Steve had needs,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and he wanted them fulfilled.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's a literary event, so I'm trying to dance around.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But, alright. So. 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We're driving in the Mercedes and Steve has his hand on my knee. 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And it was spindly and cold.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And uh. And he says 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
he says he wants to go to my place. And at the time I was living with 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
a very surly taxi driver in his late sixties. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
He was a guy I knew through a guy I knew I ended up in 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
this apartment and I knew he wouldn't take kindly

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to Steve. And then Steve suggested that we go to his place 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
but I had been there once before and it was like the typical eighties cocaine guy 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
kind of apartment with all the black lacquer furniture.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And he had that ?Nagel? print from the Duran Duran album over the bed.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And I, I the thought of going back there I couldn't I just 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and waking 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
up there was so horrible. So he suggested 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that we pull 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
into a parking lot on the West Side Highway. 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So he pulls

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
into the parking lot he and he rolls down the window and he says to the attendant he says,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
"Listen I want to park all the way at the back of the lot alright.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
By the water. Right?"

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And the attendant says, "Well, what for?"

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And Steve says, 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
He says, "I feel like fuckin' my girlfriend, if that's ok with you"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And the attendant like looks at me.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And I'm looking down. 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And I'm staring at my knees. And I'm thinking oh my god.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Steve just called me his girlfriend.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Thank you.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Applause]
