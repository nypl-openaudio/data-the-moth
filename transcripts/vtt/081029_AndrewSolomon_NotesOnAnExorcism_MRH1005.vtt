00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So I'm not depressed

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
now.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But I was depressed for a long time, and I wrote about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
being depressed, and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I lived for a long time with blinding depression, and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
had long stretches when everything seemed hopeless

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and pointless. When returning calls from friends seemed like more than I could do.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
When getting up and going out into the world seemed painful. When

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I was completely crippled with

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
anxiety. And when I finally got better and started writing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about the process of recovery, I became very interested in all of the different

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
kinds of treatment that there were for depression.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And having started as a kind of medical conservative; thinking that there were only a couple of things

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that worked -- medication, and certain talking therapies, and that that was really it -- I

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
very gradually began to change my mind, because I realized

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that if you have brain cancer and you decide that standing on your head and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
gargling for half an hour every day makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but the likelihood is

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that you still have brain cancer, and you're still going to die from it. But if you have depression,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and you say that standing on your head and gargling for half an hour makes you feel better,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
then you are actually cured. Because depression is an

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
illness of how you feel, and if you feel really great after you do that, then you're

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
not depressed anymore. But I began to think all kinds of things could work, and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I researched everything ranging from experimental brain surgeries

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to hypnotic regimens of various kinds. I had people

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
writing to me because I had been publishing on this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
subject. There was one woman who wrote to me and she said that she had tried actually.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
electroshock treatments and a variety of other approaches to depression -- 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
medication and therapy -- and she had finally found the thing that worked for her, and she

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
wanted me to tell the world about it. And that was making little things from yarn.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Some of which she sent

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
me, and none of which I'm wearing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
right now. But in any event. Um, I had that, 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
um, that rich engagement. And I also became interested, as I was doing this work, in the idea

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that depression existed not only in the civilized west, as people

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
tended to perceive it to exist, but

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
actually across cultures, and had existed across time.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And so when one of my dearest friends,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
my friend David Hecht, who was living for a little while in Senegal, said to me, "Do you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
know about the tribal rituals that are used for the treatment of depression here?"

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I said, "No I don't know about them, but I would like to know about them." And he said, "Well if

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
you come for a visit, we could try to do some research on this topic."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And so I set off for Senegal. And I met David. And I was

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
introduced to David's then-girlfriend, now ex-wife,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Hélène. And it turned out

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that Hélène had a cousin whose mother was a friend

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of someone who went

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to school with the daughter of a person who actually practiced the Undop.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And that I could therefore go and interview this woman who had practiced the undop.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so we went off, um, to a small town about two hours outside of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Dakar,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and I was introduced to this extraordinary,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
old, large woman wrapped in miles and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
miles of African fabric printed with figures of eyes. And she

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
was Madame Diouf. And we did an interview for about an hour, and she told me all about the ndeup.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And the end of it, feeling rather daring, I said, "Listen," I said, "I hope...

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I don't know whether this is something you would even consider," I said, "But would it be possible for me to attend

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
an undop?" And she said,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
"Well, I certainly never had a foreigner (the local word was toubab) I've never had a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
foreigner attend one of these before," she said, "but

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
actually," she said, "I mean, you've come through these friends and these connections," she said. "Yes. The

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
next time I perform an ndeup, you may be present." And I said, "That's fantastic!" I said,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
"When are you next going to be doing an ndeup?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And she said, "Oh, it'll be sometime in the next six months."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I said, "Six months is quite a long time for me to stay here in this town,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
waiting for you to do one." I said, "Is there anyone who might... maybe you could expedite one

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
for somebody? Move it forward? I'll pitch in."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And she said, "No, it

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
really doesn't work that way." She said, "I'm sorry but that's how

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
it is."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And I said, "Well, I guess I won't be able to see an ndeup then, but even so, this conversation has

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
been so interesting and so helpful to me, and I'm, I'm a

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
little sad leaving here about not actually getting to see one, but I thank you."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And she said, "Well, I'm glad that you could come. I'm glad it was helpful." And she said, "But there is

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
one other thing." She said, "I hope you don't mind my saying this..." And I said,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
"No, what? What is it?"And she said, "You don't look that

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
great yourself." She said, "Are you... you are suffering

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
from depression?" And I said, "Well, yes," I said, "it

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
was very acute, it's kind of a little better now, but, yeah, I still do actually

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
suffer from depression." She said, "Well, I've certainly never done this for a toubab

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
before, but I could actually do an ndeup for you."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And I said, "Oh!" I said, "What an interesting idea!" I said,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
"Well, yes, uh, sure. Yeah, absolutely yes,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
let's, let's, let's do

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that, then I'll have an ndeup." And she said, "Oh well, that's great," she

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
said, and she gave us some sort of fairly basic instructions, and then

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
we left, and my translator -- the aforementioned then-

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
girlfriend now ex-wife of my friend -- 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
turned to me and she said, "Are you completely crazy? Do you have any idea

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
what you're getting yourself into?" And I said, "Well, you know, I mean, all these things

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
are very interesting." She said, "You're crazy!" She said, "You're totally crazy, but I'll help you if you want."

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So we had left, and the first thing we had was a shopping list. There had been... you could get

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
them to buy the stuff, but you had to pay a surcharge. I said no, we'd buy the stuff, so we had to go out,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
we had to buy seven

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
yards of African fabric.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We had to get a calabash,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
which was a large bowl fashioned from a gourd. We had to get three

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
kilos of millet. We had to get sugar. We had to get Kola beans. And then we

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
had to get two live cockerels, two roosters, and a

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
ram. And so Hélène and I went to the market with David

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and with these other people, and we got most of the things, and I said, "Well, but what, what

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
about the the ram?" And Hélène said, "We can't buy the ram today; what are we going to

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
do with it overnight?" So I saw the sense of that. So the next

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
day, [Laughter]

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
the next day we got into a taxi to go back out

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
two hours to where we were going. And I said, "What about the ram?"And Hélène said, "Oh, we'll see

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
a ram along the

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
way." We were going along and going along,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and there was a Senegalese shepherd by the side of the road with his flock, and we stopped

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the cab and we got out, and we

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
bought the ram for seven dollars. And then we had a little bit of a

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
struggle getting the live ram into the trunk of the taxicab. So.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
But the cab driver seemed not at all worried, even by the fact that the ram kept relieving himself.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
in the trunk of the taxicab.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And so then, we got to Rufisque, and we got there. So here I am, I'm

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
ready for my close up. And the thing about the ndeup is that it

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
varies enormously depending on a whole variety of signals and symbols that come

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
from above, so we had to go through this

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
whole shamanistic process, and I still didn't know really very much of what

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
was going to happen. So first I had to change out of my jeans my T-shirt and put on

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
a loincloth.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And then I sat down. And then I had my chest and my arms rubbed with millett

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and then -- which is a grain -- and then someone said, "Oh, we really should

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
have music, um, for this," and I said, "Oh great!" And I thought, you know, drumming, I thought some

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
atmospheric thing. And she came out with her very prized possession, which was a battery operated

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
tape player, for which she had one tape, which was Chariots of Fire.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So we started listening to Chariots of

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Fire, and in the meanwhile I was given, sort of,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
various shamanistic objects. I had to hold with my hands and drop them. I had to hold them with my feet and drop

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
them. They would sort of say, "Oh, this augurs well, this augurs badly" -- there were five assistants to Madame Dopif

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
who had all gathered

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
around. And we sort of spent the morning like this, and it was all really just fine, and then

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
they said, it was maybe, we'd start at about eight, maybe about eleven, eleven-thirty, they said, "Well

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
now it's actually time for the central part of the ritual," and I said,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
"Okay." And the sound of drumming began -- the drumming I'd been hoping for -- the drumming began.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And so there was all of this drumming. And it was very exciting, and we went to

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
the central square of the village where there was a small,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
makeshift wedding bed that I had to get into with the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
ram.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And I had been told it would be very very bad luck if the ram escaped. And I had to hold on

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
to him. And that the reason we had to be in this wedding bed was that all my depression and all my

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
problems were caused by the fact that I had spirits. In Senegal, you have spirits sort

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
of

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
all over you the way here you sort of have microbes: some are good for you, some are bad for you, some are neutral. Anyway,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
my bad spirits were extremely jealous of my real life,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
sexual partners. Some of whom are here

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
tonight. And, um, [laughter] uh, that we had to 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
mollify

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the anger of the spirits. So I had to get into this wedding bed with the ram,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and I had to hold the ram very tightly. Because he, he was not having a good life,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
this ram. And he, of course, immediately relieved himself on my

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
leg. And the entire village had taken the day off from their work in

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the fields and were dancing around in concentric circles. And as they danced,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
throwing blankets and sheets of cloth over us. And so we were gradually being buried, and it

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
was unbelievably hot, and it was completely stifling,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and there was the sound of the stamping feet as everyone danced around us, and then these drums were getting

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
louder and louder and more ecstatic and more ecstatic, and I was just about at the point which I thought

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I was going to faint or pass out. At

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that key moment. Suddenly all of the cloths were pulled off.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I was yanked to my feet, the loincloth that was all I was wearing was pulled from me,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the poor old ram's throat was slit, as were the throats of the two cockerels, and

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I was covered in the blood of the freshly slaughtered ram and the cockerels.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And so there I was naked, totally covered in blood. And they said,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
"Okay, that's the end of this part of

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
it," and I said, "Well, OK." And they

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
said, "But, uh, you," they said

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we're,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
actually, we, but there's the next piece comes now." And I said, "OK." And we went over back to the area where we had done

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the morning preparations. And one of them said, "But look, it's kind of lunch time, why don't we just take a break

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
for a minute.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Would you like a Coke?"

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I don't drink Coke that much, but at that moment it seems like a really, really, really good idea and I

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
said, "Yes." And so I sat there, naked and completely covered in animal blood,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
with Flies kind of gathering, as they will when you're naked in covered in animal blood, and

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I drank this Coke. And then when I had finished the Coke, they said, "Okay, now we

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
have decided the sort of final parts of

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the ritual." They said, "So first you have to put your hands by your sides

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and hold your, stand very straight and very erect." And I said,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
"OK." And then they tied me up with the intestines of the ram.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And in the meanwhile it was hanging from a nearby tree and they were... there were some people doing some

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
butchering of it. And they took various little bits of it out. And then I had to kind of

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
shuffle over, all tied up in Intestines. Which most of you probably

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
haven't done but it's hard.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I had to

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
shuffle over, and I had to take these little pieces of the ram, and I had to

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
dig holes. And I had to put the pieces of the ram

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
in the holes. And I had to say something. But what I had to say was actually, to me,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
incredibly, strangely touching in the middle of

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
this weird experience. I had to say, "Spirits,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
leave me alone to complete the business of my life, and

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
know that I will never forget you." And I thought, "What a kind thing

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
to say to the evil spirits you're exorcising, and that, 'I'll never forget you.'" and I

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
haven't. So, anyway, there were various other little bits and pieces that followed. I was given

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
a piece of paper in which all of the millet from the morning had been gathered. I was

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
told that the next morning, I should sleep with it under my pillow and in the morning get

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
up and give it to a beggar who had good hearing and no deformities. And that when I gave it to him,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that would be the end of my troubles. And then the women, sort of all filled

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
their mouths with water and began spitting water all over me, which it turns out is the

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
sort of -- it's the surround shower

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
effect. And rinsing

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the blood away from me, and it gradually came off. And when I was clean they gave me back

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
my jeans, and everyone danced and they barbecued the ram, and we had

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
this dinner, and I felt so

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
up! I felt so up. It had, It

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
had been quite

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
an astonishing experience. Even though I didn't believe in the animist principles behind it,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
all of these people had been gathered together cheering for me, and it was

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
very exhilarating.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And I had a very odd experience, five years later, when I was working on my current book.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and I was in Rwanda doing something else altogether, and I got into a conversation with someone there,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And I described the experience I've had in Senegal. And he said, "Oh, you know, we have something that's

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
a little like that." He said, "That's west Africa this is east Africa; it's quite different. But.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
there are some similarities in some rituals here." He said, "You know, we had a lot of trouble with Western

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide. And we have to ask some of them to leave."

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And I said, "What, what was the problem?"And he said, "Okay, they came, and

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
their practice did not involve being outside in the sun, like what you're describing, which is after

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
all where do you begin to feel better. There was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
again when you're depressed and you're low and you need to have your blood flowing."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
He said, "There was no sense that everyone had taken the day off so that the entire community

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
could come together to try to lift you up and bring you back to Joy."

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
He said, "There was no acknowledgment of the depression as something invasive and external that could

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
actually be cast out of you again." He said, "Instead, they would take people one at

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
a time into these dingy little

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
rooms, and have them sit around for an hour or so and talk about bad things that had happened

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to them."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
He

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
said, "We had to get them to leave the country." [Laughter] Thank

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Applause]
