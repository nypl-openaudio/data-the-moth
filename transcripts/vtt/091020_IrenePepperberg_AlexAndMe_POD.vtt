00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay. So it's 1970s, and I'm getting my doctorate

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in theoretical chemistry from

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Harvard. And I'm watching Nova programmes on this ground breaking work

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
on training animals to communicate with humans – work on signing chimps and dolphin studies –

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I decide that's it, I've had this epiphany, I'm going to change my whole field and do this work.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I'm going to do it with

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a parrot. Parrots talk, they live for a long time! I thought this was the most

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
incredible idea in the world. That I'd be part of this, this revolution. I finished

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the degree. I study up. Everything I can in the field. I write my grant proposal I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
submit it thinking yes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And no. The reviewers come back asking me what I'm smoking. [laughter] The last

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
time parrots and humans were connected – unlike apes where we're connected, you know, pretty closely genetically – 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
280 million years ago. All right, you know, big big difference.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Um, parrots, unlike dolphins, they have this little tiny brain the size of a shelled walnut. You know, dolphins have this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
big brain, it makes sense to work with them. Not with a

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
parrot. Plus, I'm working with an animal that's a pet.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You know, I mean, how am I going to keep my scientific objectivity there? And plus –

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm not going to use the standard scientific techniques of the day, which means starve your animal

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to 80% of its normal body weight, stick in a Skinner box and go from there. [laughter] No, no, I'm going to just talk

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
right. Even my

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
bird. Yeah, right. Even my then-husband, who is a neurophysiologist, says, "No, no Irene.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
no, no, Irene, until you can stick an electrode in its head and get a P300, it's not science. And I look at him blankly, cause like you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
look at him blankly, 'cause, like you, I'm saying, "A P300, what's he's talking about?"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay. So I, but I- I'm really determined, I go out and I buy

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a parrot, it's a grey parrot – that's the name of the species and the color – he's a grey, different shades of grey,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
bright red tail, weighs – he's about this big – weighs about a pound, I name him Alex

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
for Avian Learning  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
experiment." [laughter]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And so I started training him, by modeling ?system?. He's learning a couple

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
labels and I- I put in the grant proposal. And this time I'm really lucky, I have somebody on

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the panel who studies birdsong – who recognizes the striking parallels between

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the development of vocal communication in birds and humans.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So I get a grant for a year. Now, most grants are for 3 or 4 years, because, if you get it for a year

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as soon as you get the grant, you have to resubmit it, and, you know, you have to get some data in between there. But I ?figured?, no –

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we are on our way, this is gonna work.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, it wasn't quite that simple. Um, Alex and m- my life were more like "The Perils of Pauline"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
than anything else, 'cause any time anything great happened, there was always something that then happened

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to bring us back down, and it was quite a rollercoaster

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of a life, but at the beginning we started this work. And in Alex's first 10 years he

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
learned about, oh, about 50 labels for objects. He learned to label 7 colors.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
He learned to label 5 shapes – 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
cornered. He labeled different materials, he understood concepts, so I could show him the object and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'd say, "Alex," you know, "What's this?"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And he'd say, "Block." And I'd – "Good birdy, an- and what color?" "Blue." "Good boy, and what shape?"

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"4 corner." "And what matter?" "Wood."

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And he combined these labels, so he could identify 150 different things. This is a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
parrot, brain size of shelled walnut, could label that 150 different things. He learned concepts of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
bigger and smaller. So I could show him two things and say, "What color bigger? What color smaller?" and he'd tell me.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
He learned, and this was really extraordinary, concept of same and different.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So I could show him two things, and not just tell me that they were same or different,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but he could tell me what about them was same or different.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So I'd say, "What same?" and he'd tell me color, shape, matter or none – if nothing

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
were same or different. And this was pretty exciting work, and, again Alex was about

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
10-years-old, and I'm invited to the International Primatological Congress. This is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
a big deal. International Congress, I'm speaking in front of 1,000

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
people, and I'm the only person there who is not a primatologist.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I am the one person who has been invited to talk on comparative behavior. And I'm talking

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I'm talking about a bird – again, brain size of shelled walnut – to all these people who are working with apes

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and orangutans and whatever.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I get up and I give my talk. At the end of my talk, one of the sil-, we call them the silverback males,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and one of the [laughter and applause]

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
one of the senior, you know, senior primatologists gets up, and I'm going, "Okay, here it comes," you know, "I'm just going

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to get totally creamed." And he, you know, [clears throat and feigns British accent]

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
"Well, you know, ver- very, very interesting little study you did there, um, but you mean to tell

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
me that your bird did something much more complicated than ?premax? apes?" And

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I want to say, "Yeah, I'm backwards and in heels, you know, to be honest."[laughter]

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But I- I say, "No," and I smile, I say, "No sir," you know, "That's right, sir, he did," and, and I'm thinking, "Okay,"

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and he says, "Oh!" and he sits down. And I'm going, "[exclaims] I've done it! I've made it." You know? Yay! Except,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
you know, I should have been, you know, drinking gallons of champagne at that point.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But a couple of weeks earlier I had gotten this letter from the National Science Foundation saying, "You know what?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It was a nice proposal, but we ran out

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of money, so, no more funding." So I'm sitting there going, "Okay? How are we going to keep the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
lab going at this point?" So here's Alex doing this great

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
stuff, and you are having some troubles with the funding, and this was, this again, this was the story of

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
our lives.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So we fast forward a little bit, and it was still very hard for me to get some

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
recognition from colleagues, even wi- with these successes. There was always the question of

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
scientific objectivity. And I dealt with it by treating Alex like a colleague, um,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the way I would treat my students. You know, you work

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
with them, you teach them as much as you can, you respect

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
them. But you- you draw a line between the way you interact with them and the way you interact

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
with- with your own children, or the way you'd interact with your significant

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
others, to keep that scientific

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
objectivity. And, it wasn't – didn't always stick. I mean, when my marriage fell apart

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and I was getting- getting a divorce. And it comes down to dividing the property, and my husband says, "Well, you

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
take the bird and I'll take the dog." And part of me is going, "Hey, cool," you know, "no fights with him

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
about the bird," but the other part of me's going, "Alex isn't a pet, like our dog!"

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You know, "He's my scientific center!" You know, "How could you say this?" but,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
you know, we're- we're doing okay, and- and, again, by this time we're doing a lot of publicity, we're doing Scientific

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
American Frontiers and Discovery Channel and 48 Hours and

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Alex is about 15, and we get a, um, invitation to do radio from the BBC.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And by this time, Alex's personality is really coming to a

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
fore, because he's learned not just to answer questions, but to label and to interact and ask

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
me questions. And, so now I'm – I'm got this radio, and I'm thinking, "Radio?" You know,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I could ask him anything, and I could say, "Yes, good boy!" because, you know, they can't see what- what's going on. [laughter]

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So I think, "Alright, how am I going to do this?" So I go, "Okay." So I think, so I start the program I say, "Okay, I'm holding

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
an orange, square piece of wood, and I'm going to ask Alex some questions." So you hear my heels,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
"click click click" as I go into the room, and I go, "Alex! Going to ask you some questions, going to do some work!" And I go, "Alex,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
what color?" And little birdy voice, "No, you tell me what shape." [laughter]

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
"Oh, okay, Alex, it's 4 corner, now, can you tell me what

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
color?" "Tell me what matter." [laughter] "Okay, Alex,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
it's wood, can you tell me what color?" "No, how many?" [laughter]

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
"Alex, there's one toy here." And- and, you know, part of me, again, is going, "Oh, this is so cool!

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
He's not just acting like a little robot. And he's interacting with me, he's talking with me." The other part of me is going,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
"Um, but they really want to hear him answer some questions." So I'm going, "Alex, come on, what color?" and he goes,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
"No, tell me what shape," and I go, "Okay, Alex, timeout. You're misbehaving," and you hear my heels

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
as I start to walk out the door, giving him a timeout, and then comes a little birdy voice.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
"I'm sorry. Come here! Orange." [laughter]

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
obviously, I treated Alex like a colleague, but he didn't necessarily treat me like a

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
colleague. And, again, we had, you know, we had some ups, we had some downs. I was

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
at Arizona at that point, we left Arizona for a number of reasons, we got a gig at the Media Lab at MIT.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Those of you who know – you're local, you know that, what that is. Big time. I'm

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
hired for temporary

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
position, um, that could be extended, to do – use the bird as a model

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
for intelligent learning systems.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But once I'm there and I start looking at all the gizmos and whatever they have, I start developing, for

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the sponsors,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
animal-human communication systems – to enrich the birds lives, all these animals.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
InterPet Explorer, web browsers for parents, things like that. And tho- those of you who know the Media Lab

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
know that the sponsors come – who've given us all this money to do these

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
things – come twice a year to see what we've done with their money.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Well, word had gotten out that there was a live bird. And they wanted to see

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Alex. And they come through in waves, 5 to 7 minutes. And I was setting up the InterPet

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
thing, and like, "No no no no, we want to see Alex do

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
his phonemes!" And I'm going, "Oh, whatever you guys want, you know, I'll do it. Phonemes!" What we were

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
doing was showing him refrigerator letters – the things y-you show your kids to have them sound out

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
the letters – in the hope that somewhere down the road we could put the letters together and he

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
could maybe sound out a label? To see if he understood what these sounds meant.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Okay, so, but he's at this very early stage! And the task at this point, we put all

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the letters on a tray. They're different colors.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And then, you know, we ask Alex, "What color is, you know, ["s" sound]?" You know. And he goes, "Blue." "Good birdy."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
"Want a nut.""Okay, Alex, you can't have a nut, we've only got these people for 5 minutes!" Um, you know,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
let's do another thing, okay, you know,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
"What sound is green?" "["sh" sound]." "S.H., good birdy." "Want a nut!"

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
"Wait, wait." So, we do this several times, and each time he's getting more and more upset

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
because he's not getting his reward. And finally, after about 4 or 5 times, he looks at me, he goes, want nut!

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Nnn uh tuh. [laughter]

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000
["n" sound] ["u" sound] ["t" sound]." [laughter]

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And, in typical Alex, you know, I'm thinking, okay, he's telling me, "Stupid, do I have to

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
spell it for you?" But the other part of it is, you

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
know, I'm thinking, he's gone light years

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
ahead of us! Because ["n" sound] and ["t" sound] were on the tray, but ["u" sound] was

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
not! So he had figured out –

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
himself – how to split the words apart, into the sounds, and use them. And this- this was the type of

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
thing that was going on.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
on. So, aga- again, after all of these high points, you know, the Media Lab gig

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
falls apart, um,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I'm actually on unemployment for a while, I get a, a Radcliffe Fellowship to help

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
things through. But to keep the lab going, I'm going to bird clubs every other

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
weekend, to – literally, to raise money, I have to raise $100,000 a year to keep the lab going.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And it's getting more and more crazy, and we're trying to figure out what's going on, and my colleagues at Harvard have this

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
great

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
idea that Alex has been so interactive and fun, maybe we should start looking at how he

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
sees the world. Literally. Can he do optical illusions?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So we put together a grant, and, of course, it's rejected the first time, we fix it up, we resubmit

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
it. And it's September 2001, and the grant is approved and funded.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Okay, not for the 3 years, of course, that we asked for, but for a

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
year. So I'm really excited, because, you know, I'm thinking, "History!" Okay, again, just

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
like before. We'd had some data, I knew I could resubmit it, everything would be fine.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Things are turning around, and a little bit later that week I'm sitting at my desk, eating breakfast, which

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I do, emails are coming in from Europe and- and

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Japan. And one comes in from Europe, ?italk? has been funded. Yay, yay!

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Okay. It's a big European consortium, millions of euros coming through for

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
this, I'm a consultant, no real money but they send me to Europe once a year,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
again, to use Alex as a model for intelligent learning systems, and I'm thinking, again, "Yes!"

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Justification of our work. We're on an upswing. I'm so excited. Get a second cup of

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
coffee, sit down, and there's another email with the tag "Sad news from the head vet

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
at Brandeis," where the birds are.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And I'm thinking, Okay, you know, some technician, there might be a problem, you know, in the family, somebody sick, we're

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
going to get flowers, it's a, it's a standard thing. And I open this email.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But it's not exactly about a tech, except that one found a dead parrot in the back

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
left hand corner of the room. And I freeze. And I'm going, this- this,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
this is not true, it can't be, I mean, this is, this is a nightmare, right? I'm going to wake up. But I call Brandeis and,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
no, Alex has passed in the night. And I go into complete shock, 'cause,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
'cause this is a bird, he's now 30-years-old, we're supposed to have another 20 years here.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And I can't, I can't believe it. I mean, obviously. I'm not functioning.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Um, I kept a diary but, I- I can, you

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
know. It's hard to even talk about it now,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but, um, so over the weekend friends come up, they drive from Washington to be there with

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
me to make sure I'm fed, to roll me into bed, so I can – I won't sleep but, to get some rest.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Other friends locally are taking care of me to make my board of directors from the foundation

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
sets up an obituary, because I- I can't, I mean, I'm just totally out of it. I- I'm like

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
walking into

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
walls. And Monday morning comes, and I call the Brandeis um

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
PR folks, the folks I've been working with for all these years – because every time Alex had done something cool,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the media would pick up on

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
it, and they would, you know, there'd be this little thing of-

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of stuff, and we- we'd do some interviews. And so I call them, an- and ?Lara?, my friend

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
there, says, "Irene, I- I'll let, I'll put this out, but, you know, this is a bird. I mean, it's not going to get any

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
traction, but I'll put it out." And I say, "Fine,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
whatever." And by the time I drive the 40 minutes from my house to-

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to Brandeis, my cell phone is ringing off the hook, my lab manager's cell phone's ringing off the hook,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
the lab, ?his? phone is ringing off the hook. We're being asked for interviews all over the

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
world. And I'm, you know, interview mode I can handle. I've done this for years.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Pick up phone. You know, close eyes, answer questions as

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
they come, hang up phone, take the next interview, fine. That I can deal with.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And I'm doing this for a week. Meanwhile, emails are pouring in, 3,000 to my own account.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Boxes and boxes of letters are coming from people all over the world. Alex gets 3

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
articles in The New York Times, an obituary in The Economist. I mean, you

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
know, [laughter] yeah! World leaders, not- not a parrot. And I'm

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
still in- in total shock, it's just nothing's coming through. And finally, I get this- this

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
big box of letters, but there's a little box inside, and I open it up, and it's from grade

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
school 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
class. And the week before Alex died, the teacher had brought her grey parrot into

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the classroom to teach them about animal intelligence and conservation issues. And when

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
the kids learned about Alex's death, they said they all wanted to write sympathy notes.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So they

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
all drew pictures of Alex. And then – little notes to me.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And I'm opening one of these, and it's from a little boy, and he

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
says, "I know how you feel. My grandma died this summer. And someday your heart will heal."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And that's when this- this, all these barriers that I had put up – to

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
keep Alex

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
on the other side of my emotions, so I could do the science – it came through

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that there wasn't going to be any more science. Alex was gone. And all these emotions

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
broke through. And I realized I had lost the most important being in my life. Thank you.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
[Applause]
