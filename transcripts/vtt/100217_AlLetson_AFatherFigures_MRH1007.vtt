00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's,uh, late March - several years ago - and I'm in the Jacksonville Memorial...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Jacksonville Memorial Gardens graveyard and, uh,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And, uh, I've got on this black suit and I'm lost.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And this black suit I wear here. Every. Every time I come here this time of year

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
year and By the end of the day the suit will.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Suit will have grass stains on my knees. I'll have walked

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
walked this area several times looking for a grave that I can't find. And, um, I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I will feel like...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
like, the worst human being in the world. The worst

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The worst ex-husband. The worst father

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Because I can't find the grave of my daughter.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Lauren Lashonda Letson was born March 27, 1999. She also

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
passed away on that day. But how we got there is a long story

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
long story. It goes back way back. See, I got married really young- I mean really young

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
mean really young, so young that I was actually playing with Legos and reading comic books at the time

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
time and. You know, the marriage might have worked out. It may have

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
been OK, but, right after we got married I got a call from the Seattle Tacoma

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Seattle-Tacoma, Washington District Attorney's office telling me that I had a paternity case against me.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
case against me.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
me. See when I was seventeen I'd gotten a girl pregnant I didn't know about it. She moved away and six years later

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
years later she popped up. And

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
up and. So that really put a lot of strain on a young relationship

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
young relationship. Um, and so, at the time, I was a flight attendant, which

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
flight attendant, which was really cool because when things got bad at home, I could get on the plane and leave, but

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
leave, but you know as time went on, um, and you have a couple

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a couple that has the emotional maturity of the entire cast of 90210 [laughter]

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The first series, not the second. [laughter]

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Things get

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
get really hard, you know, and it just became a little bit impossible and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Impossible and things were falling apart everywhere, and as we all

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
As we all know when a marriage is falling apart, the number one thing you need to do to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.000
to bring that marriage

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
bring that marriage together, is have a baby. And so I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so I wasn't really excited

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
really excited about having a child, I mean you know I was just kind of like, you know

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
like like, you know whatever. It's whatever. I would go to all the doctor visits. I did all the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
all the requisite things that, you know, a good husband a father does, but I wasn't crazy

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
about the idea

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
idea. And then one night, um, I was in the bed with my ex-wife and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
ex-wife and, um, my back was to her stomache

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
stomach. And the baby started kicking me. And she kicked

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
kicked so hard- it was really late at night, like one o'clock. She kicked so hard that it woke me

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
up and, you know, I'm a little groggy

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
groggy and so I poked her back. [laughter] And she kicked! And I poked

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I poked and she kicked and I poked and she kicked and, and we must have played for about a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
half an hour. You know, it was a great time until her mother woke up and told us both to go to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
sleep. [laughter] So, um, after that

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that you know, I, I fell in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I, I fell in love. I would play music on her stomach, I would sing to her, I would read books to her,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
books to her- the whole nine. I, I fell in love with this little girl. And when my wife gave

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
wife gave birth to, uh, my daughter, Brooklyn, she

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
she came out and she was screaming. And I walked over to her and I said, "What's the matter baby?"

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
baby?" and she stopped screaming and she turned her head towards me, and after that, like, the deal was sealed.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
was sealed. Like,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Like, I, you know, she was, uh, she would cry sometimes, you know, as an infant.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And all I had to do was come in the room and she'd stop. I used to have conferences with her when she was like six months old, telling her

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
old telling her, "You know, listen. You have to be nicer to your mother. It's not cool that you only want me." She was

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
She she was really tight with me, but

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
me. But, the marriage didn't get better. Things were falling apart, and I wasn't the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
best husband, I was really immature. And, after a while I decided that, I just,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I had to leave.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So, we, we, started doing the, uh, break up game, where you go away for a week and then you come

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
back and you go away for a week and you come

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
back and, one of those weeks when I had come back, one thing led to another and,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
She got pregnant again. And, I, I thought to myself, "Well, OK. OK. I can't

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I, I can't leave now. Like, you know, what kind of man would I be to leave this woman with

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
this woman with two

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
with two little babies?" So, I decided to stick it out but I was

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
just so angry. You know? Because I felt

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
like my entire life I didn't know who I was and I was finally beginning to figure that out.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And who I was, wasn't really fitting into this concept of what

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
this marriage was. But, I decided to stay and, you know, I did all the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
things that a good father is supposed to do.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I went to all the doctor's appointments. You know, I tolerated the baby shower

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
all of that stuff.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You know, and, um, one night, I was laying in the bed and, her

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
stomach was pressed up against my back, and the baby kicked.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and this time

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I was so angry. And so ticked off

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that I got up and got out the bed

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And slept somewhere else. And every time when the baby would kick, and I would feel it I would

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
get up and move. And I didn't play any songs for her, didn't talk to her, didn't

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
do anything. You know I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
just pulled myself away from her. So one morning I

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
wake up and, um, and her mother says there's something's wrong.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And later she would tell me that, uh, when she woke up, she didn't

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
feel pregnant anymore. And it's... It's funny like when you go to the hospital under

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
these circumstances... It's quiet. Nobody really

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
talks to you. No one wants to say anything.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
The nurses kind of keep their eyes on the ground and, um, they finally

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
come over and they tell us that they couldn't find a heartbeat and, my daughter Lauren was gone.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
She was, uh, nine months pregnant. About a week away from delivering

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
the baby.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And to me it just seems so crazy, like, I understood like, you know, a miscarriage happening earlier

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in the pregnancy but like, at nine months you, you think that, like, nothing's going to go wrong at this point.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, at nine months pregnant, you have to give birth. And it's

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
just like, you know, regular labor, and I remember everything about it. I remember the room. I

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
remember the way it smelled. I remember, the weight of Lauren,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
after she was born and they gave me to her [her to me?]

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
exactly how she felt in my arms.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And I remember being surprised at how warm her body was, you know, I thought because she had passed

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
away that, her body would be cold, but, it was really warm. And when I looked down at her

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
she was the spitting image.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Of my daughter Brooklyn. It could have been her twin. At this point Brooklyn

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
is about a year old

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
a year old or so and I'm, uh

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I'm, uh, I'm looking at this baby in my arms.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And for the first time you know I want her, more than anything in this world.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And there's a nurse behind me,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And, I, I, I...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I think to myself if I don't hand her to the nurse now,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I won't ever be able to let her go. So I give her to the nurse and

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
she walks away and, um, 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
God, I just remember everything: my mom was in the room and, she had brought Brooklyn to

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the hospital to see us and, Brooklyn actually took her first steps in that

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
hospital room, she crawled, walked, stumbled over to

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
me and, um, Couple days later

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Couple days later we do the funeral at the Jacksonville memorial and, I'm in that

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
black suit. And I remember my family being there and,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I remember my mother giving me all the cards.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
For bereavement. I put one of them in my suit pocket and they must of came off of some

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
flowers because there was a pin, and the pin pricked me. And it really hurt, and right when that pin pricked

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
me my mother said to hold on to these cards, because you needed the write 'Thank You' cards

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to everybody. And I thought, "I'm not writing anybody any fucking 'Thank You' cards."

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I'm there and they bury my daughter, and

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And we go home and, you know I

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
stay with her mother

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
About as long as I could, is what I felt was a proper amount of time before I could actually

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
leave. Because, I just, I couldn't take it anymore I, 

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I couldn't stand

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to look at her. Not because I thought that she had done something wrong, but because I felt that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I had done something wrong. Like I couldn't

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
stand her even looking my way because I just felt so

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
guilty that my little

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
girl, As she's grown up, you know, she

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
was fascinated with the idea that she has a little sister that passed

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
away and she would ask me about it all the time and, and I would tell her anything she wanted to know except when

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
she asked me

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
me how she died. I just could never bring that up, I could give her

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the physical explanation of, you know, the umbillical cord got wrapped around her legs and cut

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
off circulation and she passed away. I could give her that, but I felt in my heart that that was

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
a lie.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
That she died because, because she thought her daddy didn't love

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
her. And it ate me up.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And I couldn't tell my little girl that. So I would always tell it just to ask somebody

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
else, ask her mother. Years later, I meet somebody,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Fall in love

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
love. And, you know, there are just some things that don't ever get better.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You know and the person that I meet she tells me that I'm great. I tell her that I'm a murderer she

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
tells me, "No you're not." And, and you know,  it feels good for someone to

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
say it, even though I didn't believe it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And we get married. She gets pregnant.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And I'm overjoyed, I'm so happy. You know, And I am there

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
There, You know more than I've ever been, like, I'm there at the doctors things, I was actually happy at the

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
baby shower. But the [mumbled "it was a task"] [laughter]

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But, you know, I have

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
this fear in me that's

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
just eating me whole. So much so that, like, the whole front of my head

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
goes gray. I actually dye my hair now. But the whole front of my hair goes gray and while

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
all my other friends when, when their wives get pregnant they gain weight with their wives, I start

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to lose weight, and I can't sleep at night and, anything my wife tells me is wrong, I'm obsessing

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
about it. I'm staying up all night long. I'm just a wreck. You know, the slightest

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
little think could tick me off and,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
She's about, eight or nine months pregnant, and my daughter Brooklyn, who I'm still

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
extremely tight with, She asked me if this was the same

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
time that Lauren passed away. And I

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
tell her yes. And she asked me, "How did Lauren die?"

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And I just fell apart.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
I just wept and wept. I mean, I couldn't stop

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
crying. And my little girl, she comes over to

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
me and, she wraps her arms around me and she

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
says, "Daddy, I used to dream about Lauren.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And she told me to tell you that it's

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
OK". After my, uh, 

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Son was born - healthy and beautiful - 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
The next March, I went back

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to Jacksonville Memorial Gardens, and instead of

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
like, wandering, looking for a grave that I can't find I actually

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
went inside, and I asked him, you know,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"Why can't I find my daughter? Help me." And they told me

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that when Lauren was buried, we didn't have a lot of money, we could

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
barely afford the plot and we never paid for a permanent

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
permanent stone. That we just had a temporary marker

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that had been pulled up

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
up. And, so I, I um, I paid them.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
To put a marker down, for my daughter, but I've never even seen it. See, I,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I didn't have to go back there anymore. Because Lauren told

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:04.000
me that it was OK

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
OK.
