00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So I'm five minutes late for my own divorce. I'm rushing from the parking structure

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to the courthouse. And all I keep hearing in my head is, "I know you're gonna be late, Horace.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I know you gonna be late, you're always late." That's my wife.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"I know you goin to be late." I'm like ooh! I'm not gonna be late. But unfortunately I don't

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
have any time travel capabilities. So I rushed through security

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
security. I get on the elevator. I go past four other floors, I get to mine, I jump off and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
off, and...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
No one's there.  I look to my left, there are a couple benches.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 three doors. No one. I look to my right. Some more benches. Three more doors,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
more doors, no one.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
See there. I'm worried about being late. She's not even here. Matter fact no one

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is here. There were tons of people in the lobby and people on the other floors. But I'm the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
first one here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Have time... I sit down. I adjust my tie, fix my shirt. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now I can go over my head what I want to say to the judge.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Because it's only going to be me,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
my wife, and the judge. Neither of us have attorneys. And I don't want this divorce.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is her idea.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now granted I have given her a reason to want a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
divorce. But that's not the point. [laughter] I mean my parents

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
have been married, at this point,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
for thirty-six years. They have a great marriage. I know a marriage can work. I mean I'm-a tell the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
justice. I'm-a tell him, "Hey! Just give us some counseling. I love her, she loves me, we can

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
work this out.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So I've gone over this a few times in my head. And I'm noticing time is going by.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
At this point it's almost thirty minutes, and I'm getting bothered. Like, wait a minute. Did the court tell me to get here early?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So they can just wait all day? And finally a door opens. I'm like, yeah, finally. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I see my wife walk through the door.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well at least she was before she came through the door. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
comin from?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's over Horace. What do you mean "It's over?" Look

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
"Look at you! I knew you wouldn't be here! Look at you! You didn't even make it to our divorce!"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
"What you mean divorce? What do you mean it's all over?""IT'S OVER!" I'm like, "No, it can't be over! I've been sitting out here

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
for twenty minutes!"

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And my wife is so smart.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I mean I'm smart too. But she has an uncanny knack of asking me questions that I somehow forgot

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to ask myself. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Why didn't I come inside? I don't have

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
a good answer. I was just....It's over

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
"It's over." She hands me the papers. And that's when it hits me.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I just lost my wife.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I mean I just lost... my wife.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
My marriage is over.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And I literally sat

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
there and did nothing.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now and this might not seem like a big deal to you because people get married and divorced every day.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Sometimes they even do it in the same day. [laughter] But for you to understand the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
magnitude of this divorce you gotta understand my wife and me. I mean I still

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
remember the exact second when I first met her.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm a comedian. I got booked as a new comic at this brand new comedy club.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
At the same time my wife had just gotten hired -- she wasn't my wife at the time --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as the new bartender. Now I had just gotten out of a bad relationship two years ago.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
my friends told me, "Man, you have to see this new bartender at the comedy club." And I'm like, "Look, later for that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm trying to focus on my career, focus on my two daughters. Camay who's seven. Kamaria who's three.   

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And focus on my relationship

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
with God. That's enough. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Plus, I don't even drink. Never have. What I look like being with a bartender?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So I come in the club I walk down the hallway. I've bend that corner round the left and I see LaFawn behind the bar.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
She is amazing!!  So I'm walking towards her

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
walking towards her I'm like: come on, think of something to say, you are a comedian. Think of something funny, make her laugh. They like that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So I walk up I'm like.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
"'Scuse me. Can I get a Coke on the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
rocks?" She

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
laughs. I'm like yeah, I got her.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And she is amazing. I mean she has this beautiful long hair. She has these black stirrup

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
pants on with these black boots that are seamless -- you can't tell where the boots end and where the pants begin.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
She's like some cute little

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
superhero. So I'm talking to her and it's my turn to get on stage. But I'm about to up 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
there and really kill it now. And not because I need to get paid and not because I want to be funny. It's because I

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
got impress this new girl I just met. So I'm up there and I think the best thing to do is talk about

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
her. I was like yeah, I asked 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the bartender for something to drink. She gave me this little bitty cup. I said, "I wanted Coke

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
not Nyquil." Oh the crowd

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is loving it and I look over and see her laughing too. I'm like, yeah. Reelin' her in.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
All I'm thinking at this point is when I get off stage this can't be the end of this night. I got to talk to her after this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So I get to the bar and I see her going to peer through the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
curtains. I'm like, "What's wrong? Is there a problem?" She's like, "My ride is

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
not here. Supposed to be here."

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Here's my opportunity. "Hey you need a ride, I'll be glad to take you home." What I didn't realize until

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
later was that she called her ride when I was on stage and said, "Hey girl. I'm good. I don't need a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
ride." See, I told you she was smart. So we get in 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the car, we're ridin' home. She tells me that she has a daughter. ?Noelle?, who's almost two.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I'm like I've got two girls, ?Camae? and ?Kamari?. Look at it we had a whole full back seat

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
already. Now it's time to talk about the most important things.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
"Hey. What's your favorite movie." She's like, "You know what movie I loved, I saw.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I love it I can't stop quoting it." I'm like, "What?" "Austin Powers Two, The Spy Who Shagged Me."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Who Shagged Me"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm like, "What! That's my favorite movie too!"

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
THIS HAVE TO BE GOD, he put us together. Matter fact we're talking 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
about it so much we like, we got to see it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But it's not at the movie theaters now. So I'm like "Hey, let's go rent it. Let's go to Blockbuster." So

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
we stop by her sister's first to pick up a V.C.R. That's how long ago this was.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I mean Blockbuster is still open.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
open.  [audience laughs] So we go

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So we go in there. I don't have a membership. But I do happen to have all the money from my last three

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
last three work weeks on the road workin'.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So I discreetly, but nonchalantly, pull out this big knot of money. 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the pay for that movie?"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
She's like, 'Oo, he's a baller.' So I buy the movie, we go back to her house, we watched

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the movie, it's watching us. We start kissin' like we're in high school. Man.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It's amazing. We spend the night together. And that morning I leave. It's like

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I leave. It's like, she'll never be out of my life. From that

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
day forward we've been in each other's lives. Now fast forward a couple years of dating.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I ask her to marry me. We're so excited we're planning for December wedding.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But we get kinda anxious. Neither one of us wants to wait. So we go to a justice of the peace down

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
in Ohio. Get married by a judge on the courthouse steps.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So now we're married. But now instead of a December wedding, we're planning a

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
December birth. Our first child together. Another girl. Trinity.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
She's born on Christmas,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Which is my birthday. Come on how cool is this. So the next year I have

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
the biggest opportunity in my career, I'm on television. I'm traveling. Things are going better. And

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
within a year, we have another daughter.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
?Mica?, five girls. And my wife is an amazing mother. Know what?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
My dad actually says that my wife is the best mother in the world. Now I don't know

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
how he says this when my mom is sittin' right next to him.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
But

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I get his point. She is truly amazing. She makes all of their birthdays a unique

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
event. Other people even trying to hire her to plan their kids' birthdays. Then a year later we have

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
another baby. ?Halan?. Now we get six girls. We need two back seats now

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
now. We're going along, we're being good parents. But we're not

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
sharing like we used to. I'm spending more time on my career, that's why I'm successful. She's spending more time

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
on the kids, that's where she's successful. But now we're not quoting movie lines to each other. Now we're starting

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
to quote arguments in things we said wrong to each other

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
other. Then we have our first son who comes prematurely.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Xavier, he's only two pounds. This is a real traumatic time for us. A lot to go through.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And somehow it doesn't push us closer. It pushes us further

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
apart. but that's so far. Because a year later we have another child.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Isaiah. And he's born on Xavier's birthday. Another

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
cool thing. But this coolness is not enough to keep us

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
together. So we end up back where the story started, at a divorce.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Now. I'm going to be a good dad. I am. She's a good mom. So we're going to be in each other's lives.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I'm not going to go too far.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Matter of fact even though we're divorced we end up having another child, a couple of years

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
later. Little ?Astin?. (laugh)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So now I'm dating other people, she's startin' to date. But I'm still missing

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
my wife.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And I tell her even, "You know what, we're going to end up back together." And she likes to say, "No, Horace,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I'm a marry somebody new." So then one day, it's the day before Mother's

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Day. And I said, "You know what, I know you plan on going to watch that big boxing

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
fight tonight" (cause we both are big boxing fans). I was like, "Instead of that, why don't you come hang with me? Let's hang together."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
She's like, "No, I got plans." I'm like, "Come on, let's hang together and talk." She's adamant she's

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
not coming. So she goes on her merry way. Now I could have went out to watch the fight myself.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Could have hung out with my boys. Or went and found a girl to hang with. But I decided to go back to her house.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I went up to her room and had a talk with the Lord. I prayed. Pulled out

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
my Bible. I was honest

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I was honest with myself which

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
which I wasn't always doing, because I always knew there was something more

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in me, but I didn't know what I was waiting

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
on. I think I was waiting on that moment.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I told God what I was willing to do what I wasn't willing.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I asked him for what I really wanted. I said "God, if it's supposed to be that, then let it

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
happen." She came home that morning.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Now I know fights don't last all night, so I know she just wasn't at a fight party.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But that wasn't the most important thing. I sat her down and said, "Look, we can fix this.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We can fix our relationship and be together and have an amazing

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
life. And you need to tell me and be committed. And if you can't do that, then I need to leave.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And not just this house. I'm leaving the state. I'm moving, I'm a pursue my career. I'll

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
take care of the kids. But there's no way I can stay here in this city and watch you be with

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
someone else when I know you the woman I love."

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
You know what she said? She believed

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
me. She said, "Horace, you said something like that before,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
But I really believe you now.  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And I think it's because I believe myself."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We were in love on Mother's

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Day. About two weeks later I asked her to marry me again. She said yes.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And this is how I really knew things were going well. One morning she was takin' the kids to school.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And when she went at the back door the door almost fell off the hinges. Now normally this would have been

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
an occurrence where she hollered at me, "Horace, you need to fix this door, what's wrong with it?" But instead,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
she said, "Hey baby, be careful coming out the door, 'cause it's off the hinges." And normally I might have still been

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
sleepin' because I'm like, "I pick the kids up in the afternoon, you take 'em in the

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
morning." But I was up and dressed. Now before she could get our kids to school and come back with her morning coffee, 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
morning coffee, I have been to Home Depot. I good wood, nails, screws,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
hammers, saws. When she came in the house, I

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
was putting on a new door. She gently stepped past me: "Excuse me."

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I saw her going to the dining room to get on her phone. She 's like, "Girl, you ain't gonna believe

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
this. Yeah I know, 'member I told you the door was broke?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
He is building me a new door. Not just the door, the frame and everything! Girl, he

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
got a hand saw!"

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I was like, yeah, I got her again!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So we did more that summer than we did in the last five years. We traveled everywhere.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I worked with her at her job. She created her own face painting company. I'm a comedian, I'm painting' faces

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
faces. But I'm in love. She's coming to my shows with me. It's amazing. We decided to

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
plan this wedding in November. But again we can't wait. So she's like, Hey I know. Let's 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
do Nine Ten Eleven.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I like the date. But all the venues are booked up." She's like, "Man." So jokingly I tell her

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
in front of my brothers and sisters. "Hey why don't you go all the way -- nine, ten, eleven twelve."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
She's smart, she's like "Yeah, that'll work." Like, "What do you mean?" She's like, "Because the venues are

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
available on nine-nine-eleven. 

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So she gets a beautiful place. We rent it. We decide to have our

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
have our reception first. So from eight o'clock to eleven fifty nine we have a

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
great reception. And then at the stroke of midnight. Our pastor marries us on Nine Ten

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
11/12.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Twelve.  (soft laughter)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It was amazing. And I remember the week before the wedding she came to me real quietly and

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
said, "Baby, I gotta ask you something. I know you love me,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And you know we got nine children.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
How much of this getting back together is about us

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
us and how much is about the kids?"

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I said, "Look,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
forget them kids.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
[laughter]

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Because if we do this right one day going to grow up. They going to find spouses of their own and get marrieed and start their own

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
families. It'll still be you and I. This is about you and me."

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And I think to something my dad likes to say. Him and my mama been married for fifty years.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
He always told me, "Horace, Me and your mom are related to you. But we're

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
not related to each other

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The only thing that keeps us together is that we CHOOSE to love one another.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And the Bible says, 'He who finds a wife finds a good thing.'"

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I found my wife. Then I lost her,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
but I found her again.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And I'll never lose her, again.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
[Applause]

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
[Applause]
