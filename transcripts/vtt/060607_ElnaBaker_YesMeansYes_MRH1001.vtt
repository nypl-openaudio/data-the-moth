00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I am 27 years old, and I have never had sex. Um, I

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
also don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs. And I don't drink coffee.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Mormon. Yay! [Laughter] umm.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And you know it's hard being Mormon in New York City and not drinking and smoking and whatever, but it's especially

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
hard to try to live in New York and not have sex because, you know, it's like Sex in the city and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
you know, I'm young and I want to have relationships and be able to experience those things. And instead, uh,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
after 6 years of living in the city

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and not having sex, the longest relationship I was able to sustain was

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
4 weeks. And that's only because he was out of town for 2 of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
them. [Laughter] um. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And you know, in addition to that, like there's this huge part of me that would love to be considered sexy

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but you know if you're not selling sex you really shouldn't advertise. So instead I,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you know, I like to present myself as cute, uh - or, as someone in the audience pointed out,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
like I'm on Star Trek. [Laughter]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thank you!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So kind! Um. So you know I've gotten good at thinking of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
myself

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as being cute and I remember one time I was walking through the East Village and I pass this vintage

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
boutique and I, I walked in and there was all this vintage lingerie,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I happened upon this slip. And it was literally the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
sexiest thing I'd ever seen. It was like it was hanging on like an invisible Lauren Bacall. It

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
was like dark navy blue with this blue lace at the top and these

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
thin

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
straps. And I couldn't help myself. I tried it on. And I

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
remember I looked in the mirror at myself and for the first time in my life I was

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
like... I'm sexy!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Who knew that I could be sexy? and uh - woo hoo!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So I bought it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And you know, it's not like any guy's allowed to see me in it. Because even when you're Mormon, once you get married you have to wear the garment.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So it sits in a drawer in the back of my closet. But occasionally,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
late at night, I'll take it out and try it on and look in the mirror and be

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
like, 'I'm still sexy!'

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and put it back in the drawer. Um, you know, I think there's a lot of misperceptions that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
people have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
about Mormons and more than anything, the one that bothers me is this idea that Mormons

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
say 'No.' You know no sex, no drugs, no alcohol. Which I think would make me seem like a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
very boring person. But whereas I say no to certain

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
things. I try to say yes to everything else. Which makes me very pleasant! Uh,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I learned the power of saying 'Yes!' when I was going to college at N.Y.U. They used to have these

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
career fairs that they would set up for the business students. And I was a drama major so

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
like they didn't even set up booths for us. They sort of saw what was coming:

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Unemployment. Um, but if you were a Stern Business student there would be all these

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
companies trying to recruit you. So one day I was passing through this um, recruitment hall and a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
man stopped me and he was like, 'uh Are you a Stern Business

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
student?' And so I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Are you interested

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in a job at Morgan Stanley?'

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
'Yes!' And I just kept answering 'yes' to all of his questions and before I knew it I had

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
a free triangle highlighter with the three different colors.  And I was Like, this

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is amazing! And so I just started doing that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
all the time I would say 'yes!' and I ended up

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
stumbling into a paper convention. And next thing I knew I was, I went to a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
bridal convention and I kept getting all these free trinkets just by saying,'Yes!' And it all led up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to the mother of all conventions. I had some friends in town, and we went to the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Marriott in Times Square and we were having breakfast, and my friend happened to glance under the table and there was

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
a badge and it said, 'Bob Barnet 7-11 Convention'. And I was like,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
yes!  So we

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
go downstairs in this huge banquet celebrating 75 years of 7-11 so I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
start mingling with people and I end up meeting the woman who organized the whole convention.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So she starts asking me for my feedback and I'm like, 'I go to conventions all the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
time and this is the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
best convention I've ever been to. And she's like well, you know, 'Are you going on

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
today's activities?' and I was like, 'Oh, Yes!' she gave me 4 tickets to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Madame Tussaud's, 4 tickets to Radio City Music Hall, and then she said, 'Will I

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
be seeing you on tonight's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
cruise?'

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
"Yes."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And then she didn't give me tickets so I was like, 'Oh! But you know I sent all the stuff in and I never

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
got anything. And she was like, 'What?!'

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
She ran off and then came back with 4 tickets worth $150

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
each on a dinner cruise around Manhattan. So that night, me and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
my friends got dressed up, and we go on this cruise and literally there's like 500

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
7-11 employees, and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
us. So I started making friends and like I

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
didn't lie, like when people ask me what I did for 7-11 I was like, 'Come on man!

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Leave work at work, you know?!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We're here to have fun!'

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And they serve us this

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
4 course dinner, and at the end of it, you know, we're eating our dessert and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
my friend leans in and he's like, 'Elna, I dare you to make a toast.'

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And, like I don't drink so I've never made a toast, but I've seen movies. So

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I was like, 'Ye-hes!' So I take my glass and, 'dink, dink

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
dink' and everybody shut up.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
'I would like to make a toast to 7-11

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
For redefining

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
convenience!'

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And they're like, "Yeah!" And what I love about

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
saying, 'Yes' is like, it's like where you start at

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the beginning of the day and where you end up can be 2 totally different places

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
just based on all the things that you say 'yes' to.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And yet then there's this whole other side of my life where I do say no and, um, sex

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
being the biggest obstacle of them. And um, you know I think it's one thing to say no

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
to sex when you've been in a two week relationship, but it's an entirely different experience when you

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
feel like you're in

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
love. And, um, I met my 'Yes' counterpart 4 years ago.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I was working at a T.V. show he was in the audience and we started talking and it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
was immediately, I was like,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
'It's you!' And he was like, 'It's you!' And we were like, 'Yes!'. And our

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
first date was amazing we were, uh, walking down the streets of New York and we happened upon a movie 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
set and he was, like, 'We should sneak in and pretend like we're extras!' And I was, like,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
'Yes!' and so we're in

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the back of all these scenes and we ended up in the makeup trailer and the woman was like, 'Did the

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
director send you here?' and we're like,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
'Yes!' and, uh,  she said, 'What did he send you here for?' and at the same time we

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
both said, "Black eyes."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And she gave us these huge black eyes and then we just spent the rest of the day running

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
around New York City with giant black eyes. And it was

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
incredible! And literally every date, one after the other, was like, even more exciting.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And really there was only one problem: 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
He didn't know that I was Mormon.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Probably 'cuz I didn't tell him. And you know

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I totally rationalized it. I was like, you know, in addition to being Mormon I am many other things.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But I really, like, I wanted to be able to date him, and I wanted

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
to be more than 2 or 4 weeks, and so I didn't tell him and, you know,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
then like, 2 months went by. And then you start to feel guilty because you start to

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
feel like the person doesn't really know you, because they only know half of you.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And so I told him, you know, as casually as you can say that, but I was

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
like, 'Oh you know, by the way, I'm Mormon.' And he's like,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
'What?  Elna, I'm an atheist.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Can you be with an atheist?'

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
'Yes...?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And can you be with a Mormon?' and, he looked at me and he was

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
like, 'Yes.'

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And so we kept dating. And we kept going on our adventures.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And it was great except that there were these grander things that we were

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that would not leave us alone no matter how hard we tried. And I remember one of them

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in particular was when I found out that he didn't believe people had souls.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I was like, 'What?!' Like, I really didn't kno-, I thought irregardless of religion everyone believed that.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But he was like, 'No, I don't believe in souls.' and I was like 'Well, then wha-...what's inside of you?'

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
He's like, 'Well, my, you know, D.N.A.' and I was like <??exasperated breath??>,  I remember I stopped him on the

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
side rack and I put my hands on his shoulders. And I just looked into his

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
eyes, and he's like, 'What are you doing?' and I'm like, I'm

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
am looking at your soul and, and I--I can see it. And

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I can hear it and I know that it's there! and so he said, you know,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
'What does my soul have to say?' And so I listen, and I was like

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
'It says:  Fuck 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You!'

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I've been living inside you for 29 years and you've been ignoring me

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the entire time!' [laughter] And he was like

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
it's not like Mormons are supposed to swear but then like when making a religious point was that the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
only word

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that came into my

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
head. um. And so we kept dating even though

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
like at this point, I realized my soul mate doesn't actually believe in souls.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But like I was willing to be OK with that.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But then, you know, the whole sex thing comes up and he's like, you know, 'Are we going

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to have sex?' and I was like, "Y?? It isn't--No. no.' 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And, um, so then he started to pull away, and he started

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to retreat, and it's so interesting because, like, every girl knows when I guy is starting

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to phase her out.  It's like even if coincidentally he didn't answer his phone that day, it's

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
like you know, because you feel it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And so I knew that he was fazing me out and I started thinking well,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Why? Well it's probably because I'm Mormon, and it's probably because I won't have sex.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Then I really started to think about those things, you know, not as like, not as the way

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
things are as necessity but as, like truth. Like, you know, what if this person is the love of

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
my life, and I end up marrying some Mormon guy, because I'm supposed to. That, I like OK and I

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
regret the decision for the rest of my life.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Or, you know, what if he's right, and God doesn't exist? And then I end up making this

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
sacrifice for an entirely imaginary reason.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And then also you know, like, sex, when you feel like you could love someone

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
it just feels like the natural progression of things, not that it's this awful thing.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And so then I was like, well you

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
know, 'M--m--maybe I

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
could have s-sex?.. H-- no. um. No.'

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And then, um, we went out again.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And we, um, we met up and, right when I saw him I could tell it was going to look, going to be one

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
of the last times that we saw each other. And we went to this outdoor exhibit

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
but it started to rain. So we ended up back at my apartment. We put on a D.V.D. we made

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
grilled cheese sandwiches. It was like the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And we were watching the movie, but I was still wet from the rain so I stood up and went into my

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
room to change. And I took off my tee-shirt and I was just going to put another shirt on

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
when I opened my drawer and I saw that blue slip. And

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I was like, 'What if you put that on?' I was like,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
you can't put that on, it's like the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday and that would be so weird.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But then also it's like, 'But you own that, and

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
you've never worn it'...you know? and, also, 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
like what is this thing this ...sex thing? and like, you can say 'Yes!' to that,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and what I like

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
about saying, 'Yes' is that when you say 'Yes' everything can change. And sometimes

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
you want things to change. And so I took that slip out.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And I put it on. And I walked out into the living room. And he was like,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
'What are you doing?' And I was like, "Shhh!" and I walked up to him and

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
we started kissing, and then we lay down on the couch, and we were

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
kissing and, the moment started to

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
build more than it had before and, as this was happening I leaned

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
into his ear and I heard myself say, 'You need to pray and find

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
out if God

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
exists.' And he was like

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
'What?!' and I was like "What?" uh, and 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I was 'Nothing, nothing! I didn't say anything!' And so then

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
we started to kiss again. And the moment started to build again.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And then it happened again. I leaned is in his ear and I said, 'How can you

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
know that God doesn't exist unless he's at least asked?' And he was

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
like, 'What are you saying?' and I was like, 'I ...like, I don't know I just want to

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
have sex right now and instead I have God Tourette's

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Syndrome!'

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And so he sat up, and I sat up

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and he was like, 'Elna, what are you trying to ask me?' And I was like well, "Look

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the only thing...the

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
only reason I believe the things that I do is because I prayed and asked. And how can you know

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
for sure that something isn't true unless you at least

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
ask?' And so he said, 'Do you want me to pray?'

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
'Yes.'

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And so he said, 'OK. I can do that.' and I was like, 'Really?'

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And he you know, left and the minute he left my apartment I remember I knelt down.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And I prayed like I've never prayed in my life. When you say,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
'God, you can never--you never have to answer another one of my prayers, but, answer this one.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And if he prays tell him you're there.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And then of course I made the mistake of telling my sister about this, and then she told my

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
parents and my parents told my uncle and aunt and my gran and next thing you know there's like a Mormon

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
family tree across America praying that if he prays he'll get an answer.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
then I didn't hear from him for for 2 weeks, and then when I did we agreed to meet up

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
in Union Square. And we met up

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and we sat on a bench together and at first it was just small talk and so finally I just asked

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the question I most wanted to

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
ask. I said, 'Did you pray?' And he said, 'Yes.'

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And I was like, 'You did? What happened?'

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And he said that he sat in his room in silence. And that he prayed and he asked God if

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
God existed, and that he listened for a long time.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And then he realized that if he did get an answer it would just be

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
himself telling himself that he got an answer because he wanted to be with me, and that it wouldn't

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
be real.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And that was it. And the relationship ended. And you know it's, it's funny

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
because you know as hard as he tried to

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
find God, for me, and as hard as I tried to have sex for him,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
we ultimately were these things that we were: a Mormon and

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
an Atheist.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And yet, you know, before that I always thought that I didn't have sex because I was Mormon.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
But I realize I don't have sex because I don't want to have it yet, And that,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
for me, sometimes saying 'No' is actually saying 'Yes.'

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Thank

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000
you.
