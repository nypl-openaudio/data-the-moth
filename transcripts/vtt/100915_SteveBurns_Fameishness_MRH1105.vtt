00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm very excited to be here.  Thank you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
OK

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
From about 1995-96 until about 2002, I had the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the great fortune of being the host of Nickelodeon's Blue's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Blue's Clues. {Cheers} I see

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I see many of you were five in 1998.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It was a it was

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a very very very wonderful thing. But that was kind of an interesting reaction there because you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
either know that show, or you totally don't know that show.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It afforded me a sort of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
rare thing, I called it micro celebrity. Because I wasn't famous, really.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I would tell everybody that I was fameish

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which, which is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
actually different. I would say that, you know, being... Fameish people are like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
famous people without the public dignity.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
dignity that is involved in being actually famous. So.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For the uninitiated:

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Blue's Clues was an animated children's television

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
show. Wherein I would

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
galavant, if you will, with a magical animated blue puppy. And I would talk

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to salt shakers and bars of soap

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm completely unrecognizable now. But the way I looked then

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
imagined I had lime

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
green socks on and, uh, really embarrassing pleated

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
pants and, um

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a striped Polo shirt that I wore in every single

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
episode and hair

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
like Lego helmet hair. And I was

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
yopey and dopey and so excited about absolutely everything.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I had this giant red chair that I couldn't wait to sit in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
all the time. And when the mail showed up, I froke out.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Like, just 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
froke out. I would, I would leap into the air and start gambling about like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a lamb and just like swinging my arms

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And I would sing this crazy song and I would freak out and then I would scream like PeeWee Herman

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
at the AHHH-AHHHH!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It was

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
crazy. And it was awesome but it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
was it was not exactly the kind of thing that I would think would ever get me a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
date.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But it was great. And it was all to wonderful effect because the show was incredibly well thought

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
out and it was, it was incredibly educational and my favorite part of the show my job on the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
show was to talk directly through

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the camera. And and to actually cultivate, if I could a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
relationship with with an individual child through a T.V.. The conceit being that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that that I can hear them.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that they can hear me.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And that's tricky and what we found out is that it totally worked.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And kids

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
thought I was their friend - for real.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Like millions of them.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And I thought.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Oh, wow.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Because the show actually became very popular and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
despite how wonderful it was, the more popular it became, the more that started to weigh on me.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
For real, I started to think

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Well, I'm saying these wonderful things to kids. I'm saying, you know, "You are so smart" and "You can

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
do anything that you want to do" but I couldn't help thinking, you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
know, is that true?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Am I saying the right things to all of these children? It felt like a 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
really tremendous responsibility. And on top of that, my name on the show was Steve, and my name in

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
real life is Steve.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And it was becoming this sort of thing where people assumed

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I created the show or that I was Fred Rogers and, in some way. And it was this

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
indelible thing like I wore the same shirt every time, it was like a very

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
iconic iconic thing on purpose. And it was in multiple countries now.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I had moved to New York

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to be Serpico, really, you know.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You know I was either going to I was I moved to New York I was going to fail privately or

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I was going to be Al Pacino and that was it. For real and now

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
this thing was

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
happening. And it was getting huge and, well, I didn't expect any

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of this I didn't even know any children when I moved to New York,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you know. I I I'm I'm I'm really worried I'm like am I the right guy for this job?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
this job? I took it really really seriously. And my contract was up for

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
renewal and I was starting to really seriously think. As great as this is I thought they might have

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the wrong gu here

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
guy here. You know and maybe this should be a teacher or a child development specialist

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.000
or

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
something and I was. I was very very conflicted about it and I was seriously thinking. I'm having an

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
identity crisis and maybe I shouldn't do this and um

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000
then I became one of People magazine's most eligible

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000
bachelors.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And that sounded good. You know I'm

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the nerd from high school. Obviously And so that was wonderful and I thought that was the greatest thing in

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the world. I took the magazine to bars with

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
me.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Like I wanted to make T-shirts, like I was just like, whoa!

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And so then we

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
started getting fan mail like we've never gotten fan mail before. You know from from ladies and it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
was very

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
different and and and Nickelodeon kept a lot of that from me but. But one of them made it

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to my desk. And I opened it and

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it was. It was an eight by ten glossy of an incredibly gorgeous woman in a swimsuit.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I was like, Wow. She could be a swimsuit model I flipped it over and there was a letter and she was a swimsuit model.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And she had been in Playboy. She was a Playboy model. And this is her phone

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
number and, We should have dinner sometime I'm in the

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
area. And I'm like I can't do that she's clearly an axe murderer and this

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
isn't real. So I didn't I didn't call her but I did hang it on on my office

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
door and and, Because it was funny you know and

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it and it stays there for a long time and stay there for like a month two months or something and then I heard

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
a knock on my office door. And I opened it up, and there's like,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Half of the animators out there.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Now the animators. Those are my friends at Blue's Clues right. The animators. They're nerds.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
They're total nerds. They live in caves and they like move pixels

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
around and they, and they shun the light. They're the nerds they're my

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
people, right, and they're deadly serious, and they're pointing to the picture, and they're like

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you have to call her. {laughs}

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
For

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
us.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And it's clear they don't mean for them they mean for me and them because we are the same and then,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
at that moment I realize, yes this is my John Hughes moment, and I have to call the Playboy model, how do you not do that

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
not do that. So I call her and she's really who she says she is and

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
you know and I'm really me. And you know, we're not axe murderers and yeah we're going to go to a fancy restaurant.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We decide to go on a really fancy date. I'm going on a date with a Playboy model! And

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
she asks me to send a limo. And

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I suggest

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I suggest well, maybe I could pick you up in my Volkswagen Beetle.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And we can drop the car off in Brooklyn and take a car to the city, hows that? You know and she's like Well

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that sounds great too. So she lives in New Jersey, so I'm driving to New

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Jersey, terrified, I've got flowers. I'm like,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
behind the wheel and I've got the ghost of like thirty animators in the back

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the back seat of my Beatle with me. Stayed focused, Steve.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Don't let us down, so

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I drive all the way out to Jersey in the suburbs and I knock on her door and she opens the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
door. And she's at least six feet tall.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And she has giant fake boobs. Just giant.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And they weren't in the swimsuit picture so they're clearly new and clearly not real and clearly fake

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and clearly giant

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
giant. And they're here, like

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
for real. And. And I

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and I

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
honestly thought I was going to be suave and like and go in for the kiss on the cheek and give her the flowers and we'd be off but

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I couldn't like

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I was coming in under the radar. So I shake

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
her hand and I'm looking up at her and she's looking down at

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
me like oh boy, and you know she's wearing tight acid washed jeans and

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
red pumps and and and a glittery leopard print tank

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
top and I'm like. Whoa. And It's immediately awkward. And

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
like well, shall we...she's like 'Yeah.'

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So we go to my car, we sit in the car and I'm putting on my seatbelt

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and she stares straight ahead and just says 'I thought you'd be taller.'

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And I click my seatbelt and said, 'so did I.'

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
(Laughter) So now

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I'm having a panic attack and I'm like how can I save this

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 because the truth is she's really really beautiful and its a Playboy model and, you know.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This is

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
my one shot at this for sure, you know. I've got to make this right, for the animators and me.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So as I'm pulling out of a cul-de-sac I notice

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
on a mailbox a balloon a blue balloon. And then I notice on another mailbox another blue balloon leading up to

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
another mailbox with a bunch of paw prints on it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and a sign underneath it that said you just figured out Jonathan's birthday. Clearly someone

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
in her neighborhood was having a Blues Clues themed birthday party. In my car,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
at that moment I had a box of toys, Blue's Clues toys, some autographs and the

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Outfit. From Blue's Clues.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And I thought. Believe it or not.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
This is the only game you

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000
have man. (Cheers)

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 I looked at her and as suavely as I could. Would you mind?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And she was great

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
she was like, no, that would be awesome, I know these guys' come on lets do it, so I put on the outfit. And

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I get the toys and I walk into Jonathan's backyard, he's having a birthday party with a Carvel

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
cake. And I'm like hey who's Johnathan. Happy birthday! And the

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.000
freak

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
freak out. The mom freaks out, and the Dad's like, who is this man? Ya know?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And she's 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
great she runs she runs interference. She's like 'no that's really him' I'm your neighbor. And we have an awesome time

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
for like twenty minutes and these kids are awesome. And like I'm making this kid's life. It's fantastic.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Now we've got something to talk about right so we're in the car and everything's great. We drop the car off we go to

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the restaurant. And the first thing that happens is I walk in with her.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And there's. There's

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
a couple right here and it's a married couple, and the guy looks at me recognizes me

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
me clearly. And I watch him say to his wife, that's Steve from Blue's Clues.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And he's with an escort.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000
(Laughter)

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I'm thinking, 'Oh yeah that's exactly what this looks like, exactly

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
what this looks like.'

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So we sit down to have dinner and now we're trying to talk to each other

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
we've got absolutely nothing in common, She's incredibly negative she hates the restaurant, she picked it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
She hates it. It was impossible to get a reservation there. She hates the food, she orders a steak,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And then orders A1 at the restaurant, hates the wine, she's kind of mean.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And, and like we've got nothing to talk about and I'm regretting the whole thing, and this is a terrible disappointing

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
experience so I'm just drinking

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
just like drinking, trying to get through this and the animators in my head are drunk too. And they're like,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
What are you doing don't mess this up for me, you have to keep going, don't ruin this.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So it's the end of dinner and she's like I well, I want to see your place.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I did it and I was like

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
oh OK. OK. Yes. Yes. Shut down enough parts of my brain now

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
now

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
that, that I can do this. So we get back to my place and I've got

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that big red chair from the show in my house. They gave it to me on my birthday it's awesome, right?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and it happens to be

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to be at my house. She's like, oh, sit in the chair let me take some pictures!  And I was like, no I don't want to sit in the chair, the

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
means different things to me

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
You know,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 So I am, so I'm sitting in the chair eventually, and she's like well, I know what you do.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
What I actually do other than model is, I'm a stripper.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And I'm like, OK...

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
OK. Right OK that's fine. Because I'm a kids show host.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Everybody's got to do something. And she says would you mind if I show you what

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I do. And I'm like no. {laughs}

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
OK now this is going to be cool, you know, because like this, you know fourteen

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
year old Steve, this is great to him, this is like fantastic I can, this is exciting. So.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
All right fine.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And I think my God. You know. I'm going to see my first fake boobs. It's going

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to be wonderful and it wasn't at all, it was terrible and weird and.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They look like boobs that were designed by Dr Seuss, or something

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 I'm sure that there are

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
great ones but that was just like so awful and so weird.  And she's doing her dance

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and then she comes up to me and I'm in the chair and she's like, sing that song about the

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:46.000
(gasps)

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And I said. No I'm not going to sing the song. And she starts

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
getting very demanding. She's like come on, sing it sing it, and I'm like.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
No and it's very clear to me that it's an ultimatum with her. Right she's saying, sing that

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
about the mail or this is over. And at that moment even the nerds in my head

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
said, 'walk away man, just

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Just, walk away man, there's, there's

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
there's no winning here, no one's going to win. You know, just, just walk away.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But I was wasted at this point, she's drunk so

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I can't get her home so she has to stay and it's terrible and it's awkward. And I drive her back the next morning

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and I'm dropping her off and she says. My mother wants to meet you. And I'm like 'you live with your

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
mom, you're like... So she lives with her mom and her mom comes she's like you know,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
You must be Steve. Have a cup of coffee.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And I'm sitting there in their living room and her mom's got a manila folder. And she

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
opens it and she starts handing me

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
drawings. And, it turns out that much of this was an elaborate plot,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
To pitch me a children's television show

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
about giant inflatable 

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000
inflatable balloon animals. Called the Bloonies.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
it was just awful and all I wanted to do was go home, but I couldn't because I had to drive from there to the airport.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I was doing a Make a Wish event that, uh that that afternoon. Now I

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
had done a lot of work with Make A Wish before, um I don't usually

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
talk about, something I don't usally talk about, but for those who don't know what it is, it's for.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
very unhappy or often dying children. They get to choose one

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
thing. Right. And this organization makes that wish happen. Now, I got to do a lot of

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and um,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The thing that is always striking about it is no matter how awful the circumstances are

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
for the kid

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
kid. No matter what they're going through they immediately.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
as an opportunity to make their parents happy. Yeah.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And this was another one just like that. And uh,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
this is complicated for me because I also am aware that this child choose me

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Right?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Right. Like me. That's what they want. And I'm not sure what me

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Am

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
me. Am I Steve Burns, am I Steve with the shirt whose me?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I don't know which one it is, right, so it's really complicated. But

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that helped me realize

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
realize that, whether I wanted it to be true or not whether I expected

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
to be true or not the answer was 'both.'

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and that was plenty cool enough

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
for me.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Thank you Thank you Lou.
