00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, when people see me deal cards, they always ask me,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"Oh, are you left-handed?"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But I'm actually not left-handed, I'm actually very right-handed. Uh, and I tell them, "No, but I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
actually learned to deal cards

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
before I learned how to write."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Because cards were very much a part of my family. They were much a very part of how all of us

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
related to each other. And he would walk into my house and there was a little hallway

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then a stairwell that would go up that kind of divided these two sides of the house. And if you went over to the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
right, there was my father's study, my teetotaler professor

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
bearded father's study with the shag white carpet and the orange

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
furniture and this little kitchenette in the back with, with a refrigerator that had our ?Wacky Packages stickers

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
packages stickers on it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And he was a beloved professor at this school, and he was

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
very hardworking, but I could stop anytime--I could get him to stop working anytime by by sitting

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
down on, on the floor of his study, and playing cards--my

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
dad, my brother, and me--and we would do this almost every night,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and on the weekend afternoons. And I was, you know, seven. And my father

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
was this middle-

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
aged man and my brother was two years older than me--he was nine, which in

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
card years might as well have been a middle-aged man as

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
well, 'cause he was a lot better than me. And we weren't playing--we weren't

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
playing games like Go Fish or Crazy Eights or games that you would

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
expect, you know, a seven- and a nine-year-old to be playing with their dad. No, we were playing these

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
very adult games. Games like Gin,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and Hearts. And this game called "Oh Hell", which was a sort of simplified

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
version of bridge. And we would play these

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
games, and of course because my brother was older than me and my dad was

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
like thirty-five, I would never win. And every single night,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
every time we played, the card game would end the exact same way, with me picking

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
up the deck of cards

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and just slinging it against the wall, in tears, screaming,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
tantrum, and storming out of the room. And you would think if I was playing this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
think if I was playing this much that at some point somebody would have given me a lesson about how to be a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
loser,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but, but not my father. I assume--For example, my

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
father was a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
really competitive regional tennis player. We were in New Hampshire. He, he played on the regional circuit in New

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
England and he was actually quite good. He had a lot of championships. But, uh, he had this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
electrolyte imbalance, and an electrolyte imbalance--when your electrolytes go out of balance, it kind of causes you to cramp,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, he would go out in the August humidityâ€”the humidity, you know, that gets so sticky on this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
East Coast. And, uh, he would go out and he would play

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the semifinal match and he would just leave everything on the court, sweating in the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
August humidity in New Hampshire, and we would, uh, bring him home, and he would go upstairs to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to bathe and sort of wash

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
off the match. And my mother and I would sort of hear this thready, 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"Dee Dee," which was my mother's name. "Dee Dee!"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And we would go upstairs and there would be my six-foot-

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
four naked father in the bathtub. There's his penis,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which of course--like, that's another story, I'm not going to go into that now, I'll have to come back another night for that--

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and, and he would be cramped into the shape of a bathtub, because

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
imbalance was so bad that every muscle in his body would have seized up.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And so he's cramped into the shape of the bathtub, and my mother and I are

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
prying him out of this bathtub,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
trying to cover him with a towel and dragging him downstairs to try to get him into

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the back of our diaper-yellow Renault ?Le Car?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which was like the Smart Car of the seventies, but if anybody remembers

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
it, it wasn't very smart. So it was

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
this little sardine tin can of a car and I--we're wedging my six-foot-four bathtub-

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
shaped dad into the back of this car, and the only way to get him in there is

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
to sort of roll him onto his back, wedge him in, roll the window down

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
so that we could drop his size-fourteen triple-A feet hanging out of the window

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
flapping in the wind as we got him to the hospital. And he would get an IV and he would stay there

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for a few hours until his electrolytes had been replenished. And you would think that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
a sane human being, a sane human being would have withdrawn from the tournament. But, no.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
he would go back the next day and play the finals. So was the lesson that I had:

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that, that you don't lose, and you certainly aren't allowed to quit. And so

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
while every night I would throw a tantrum and throw the cards against the wall and storm out of the room

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in tears, five minutes later

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I would always come back, begging for more, to play again

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and try again.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And I would just

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
cry to my father, 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
"Dad, dad, why can't you let me win? Just let me win one time.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And he would say, "No, this is something that you have to earn on your own." But, you know

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the rest of my relationship with my dad

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
was actually quite, quite quiet--it was very nurturing.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
He was the one who, who took me to the Red Sox games and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the zoo and the museum. And every night, he was the one who who tucked me in. And he would lie down

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
--he called it a "lie with"--he would lie down and we'd talk about the day, and he would read me a story.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And it was really quite lovely. But when you walked into my house

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
on the left side--if you went to the left instead of the right, there was the kitchen.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And at the kitchen table was my mother. And I remember

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
her--I with this memory of her--my whole time I was growing up as if

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
she had sort of just rolled out of bed, as if it didn't matter what time of day

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it was, she had always just gotten out of bed, because I remember her sitting at this kitchen

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
table in her yoked night

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
gown. And she had short hair with the little, you know, puff of hair

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that was sort of ratted up, as it will

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
if your head's been lying on a pillow and you've been sleeping. And it was this still life with mom

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
sitting at the table, with her cigarette in her brass

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
ashtray and her glass of Scotch.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Her cheap Scotch. It was

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Vat Sixty-Nine, which is like the Boone's Farm of Scotches.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Because my mother was an alcoholic. And, ah, she was an alcoholic for most of the time

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that I was growing up, and I was the one in the family who decided that this was something

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I had to control, which of course created

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
this incredibly tumultuous relationship with my mother.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
When she was having people over, I was the one cleaning up

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and screaming at her that I had to do this, and I was the one who was pouring her alcohol

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
down the sink and marking her bottle when she had promised that, yes,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
she wouldn't drink anymore, and I was the one who would take her cigarettes and, and tear them up and throw

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
them in the trash, or--In my most evil moments, I would fill the carton with water

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and put it in the freezer, where she could find her ruined cigarettes,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
frozen, when she needed one.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But my mom would sit at this table

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
all day, and she would play Solitaire, and this is what she did all day--she did not join

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
in our family games, she just sat there and, and played Solitaire. And, and when I really

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
needed her, I knew that if I went up to her, particularly on a weekend

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
afternoon and

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
brought my own deck of cards and sat down next to her and started playing

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Solitaire beside her, that that was

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
when things would be good. Because that was when we could talk and she could be my mother and we

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and we could have a quiet time, and we weren't fighting with each other, and we weren't angry

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
at each other. We just played.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Side by side. So as this interesting contrast when I was

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
growing up where my relationship my father away from the cards was

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
actually quite quiet, it was quite nice, it was very nurturing, but when we were actually playing cards

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
was very emotionally violent--granted, emotionally violent by my own doing, 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
but emotionally violent, whereas with my mother everything outside

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
of the games that we played side by side was so hard, and

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
so conflicted, but when we sat down at that table together, when I sat down with her,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
it was very

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
quiet. So, when I was seventeen,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I went out into the world, and it was right at this time that my mother actually

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
went into rehab, but I was leaving the house at that point, so I really never got a chance as

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
--to experience as a child a sober mother.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So I had seen what had happened to my mother--my mother, who was

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the smartest person I had ever met.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The smartest person who I have still ever met, who had 1600's on her SAT's.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And I had seen her spend my whole

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
childhood at the kitchen table.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Which, by my father's standards--my father, who was out there in the world winning

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
tennis tournaments and being

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
this beloved professor, was complete failure. And I knew that I did not

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
want to be that, that whatever happened I could not become her. And in my seventeen-year-old mind

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I thought, "Well, I know how to do that, I'll just be my father, in the most literal sense--I'll go out and I will

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
become a

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
teacher. I will become a professor, because if I do that, then I won't be my

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
mom." So I went to Columbia, and then I went on to

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
UPenn to go get a PhD, and I was very

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
good at it because of course I didn't know how to fail at anything, so I got straight A's

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and I had a National Science Foundation fellowship, and this was my sole

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
focus--to, to go down the path of my father, who I so

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
completely wanted to identify with. And as I was in graduate

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
school there was always something that was kind of nagging me, like maybe, maybe this isn't my passion,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
maybe this isn't lighting me up inside, maybe it's not what I'm supposed to do, but of course I wasn't allowed to admit that to

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
myself because that would have been failure. If I admitted that, then that would have been

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
becoming my mother--my mother, who had met my father at Harvard while they were

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
both becoming teachers. And she had quit that path

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to sit at a kitchen table. So as I

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
was going to my first job talk, I was driving along, and I was driving to New York, and by this time

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
my mom--my sober mother--had moved to New York, and she had an apartment there. So I was driving there

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
to stay with her before I went to my first job talk, at NYU. And I got to her

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
house, and I

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
arrived at night and we had dinner and it was, you know, quite nice, and we were talking,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and after dinner I started throwing up. And I

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
started throwing up again. And I threw up again, and I was violently throwing up the whole night,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and it became clear As dawn broke and I was still very sick that there was going to be no

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
going to this job talk. And my mother, very concerned about me as the day went

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
on, took me to the hospital. And I ?as? in the hospital

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
for two weeks, very, very sick, on IVs,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and the doctors couldn't figure out was wrong with me they. They kept trying to figure out what was physically

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
wrong with me. But I knew, I knew somewhere inside, that they were looking in the wrong place, because I was actually

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
just having a nervous breakdown. Because I didn't know how to walk away from this, and I didn't know how to

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
fail, and I think that somewhere, somewhere inside of

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
my mother she saw what was happening to me--I think that she really

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
understood that I was having that moment of crisis that perhaps she had when she was younger,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and she saw that maybe she could direct me on a better path than she had gone, and she said something

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
to me. She said, "You know,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
"You know, Annie, just because you're good at something doesn't mean you have to do it."

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
But I didn't hear her. I didn't

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
hear what she really meant by that, because all I heard, all I heard, was,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Oh, that's just an excuse for the fact that you didn't do anything. That's all that is.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So now I'm just sick, I obviously had to cancel all of

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
my job talks, I'm too sick to go back to

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
school, I don't know how my life has gotten so out of control. I've actually just gotten

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
married. So the only place for me to go is to Montana, where my husband at the time had

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
actually bought a house. So I end up

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in this little town called Columbus, Montana. Twelve hundred people. This half-Jew,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
liberal, Ivy League-educated girl from the East Coast among

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
ranchers and Republicans in, you know, cow

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
country, in this, twelve hundred, you know, person town,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
in this house that had cost my husband eleven thousand dollars,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and boy, did I think he had gotten ripped off. It was made of

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
chicken wire and

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
stucco, and it had no

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
foundation, and no hot water, and the only way to turn the

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
lights on was to grab a Frankenstein

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
breaker in the kitchen and pull it down. So here I am now,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I have no money, I've just run away from school, I can't figure out how my life has gotten here, and all I know

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
is that I failed. I failed my father, I failed everything that I

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
thought that I was gonna be, and I called my brother and I said, "I don't know what to do, I have no money,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
"I don't know what to do, I have no money, I don't know what I'm gonna do,"

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And he said, "You know, there are some card games, there are some poker games in Billings, which is about forty miles away.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I'll teach you a little bit about the game, and maybe you could go play that

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
while you're trying to figure all of this out and trying to figure out what you want to do." All right.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Alright, so I get in my car and I, I drive to

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Billings, and the game is in this, this bar in downtown Billings called the Crystal Lounge,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
which is as seedy as it sounds, and if you wanted to get drugs in Billings

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that would have been a good place to go, and there was actually this guy, this, this pimp

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
from Bed-Stuy. I don't-- I-- He had got--

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
He had gotten there because he was actually escaping a murder charge, and his name

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
was Ice Cream, and he had ?Jheri? curl, and like the

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
magenta suit. Like, this was awesome. So I go into this

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
seedy bar and I asked where the game

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
was, and they direct you to this little door in the back, and you go, and you descend

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
down these narrow stairs into the basement of the Crystal Lounge,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and you enter the room and get hit in the face with the smoke, 'cause of course it's Marlboro country.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Ah, and I went

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
in and I sit down, this, this twenty-four-year-old girl,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
among

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
these old, middle-aged men, and I

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
start to play cards. And

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in that moment I realized it was like

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I was home.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It was like I was on my dad's shag carpet, playing with my father.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
These very adult games, but now I was coming to it

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
as an adult, and so I could win.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Because like my mother, I was smart. And I was smarter than they

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
were. And now it was my chance to win, and when I sat down

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and I started playing, it was the first time--it was the first time that I actually felt

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
peace. It was the first time

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
in a long time that I wasn't afraid. And I realized that I had spent

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
all of this time trying to make sure that I wasn't like my

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
mother and I was just like my dad. But when I sat down at the poker table,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
that's when I

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
made my way back to both of them.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Thank you, thank you. [cheers, applause]
