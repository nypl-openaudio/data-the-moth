00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was a pretty typical school day. Uh, 800 students at the high school

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where I worked as a guidance

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
counselor. And I was about to go into a meeting with a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
college representative who was going to meet with some juniors and seniors and try to recruit them

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to his college.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
college. And the guidance secretary pulled me aside and she whispered

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
into my ear, "Paul,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
there's a student in the front office. He's got five hostages

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and he has a gun." "Sally,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
who are the hostages?" Turns out it's the two assistant principals and three secretaries. Our principal

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
was out of the building at the time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"Who's the student?" "It's Andy."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
My heart sinks cause I talk with Andy every day.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
He's actually a teddy bear and. It's not adding up in my book. I don't

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
understand this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is four and a half years before Columbine.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There's no protocol in place.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
All we know how to do is get out if there's a fire.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And so I call the police.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
police and the dispatcher immediately

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
gets me to, uh, an officer.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And he said, "Paul here's what you need to do, you need to get all the students and staff out of

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the building.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But you can't pull the fire alarm.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You can't alert Andy to the fact that they're leaving the building because he might

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
start shooting. [pause]

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Here's a good time for me to tell you that I'm on

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
crutches. [crowd laughs] Recovering from major knee surgery and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I can't put weight on my knee. And I'm thinking how are we going to get

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
800 students out of here. But a buddy of mine, Dave,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Dave, walks into the guidance office.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And I let him know what we've got to do. There's two two big wings. And I sent him to one wing,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the technology wing and I go to the classroom

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
wing. I'm hobbling there and on the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
way I, I stop in the the conference room. And I say to the college representative.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
"We've got a guy with a gun in the office. You might

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
want to get out of here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But use a side door or you can stay if you want. But I would get out of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of here." And he leaves.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I hobbled down to the classroom wing.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And I go from classroom to classroom

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
classroom. And I just directly look

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
at the teacher.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I say. You need to listen to me.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
You need to listen and do exactly what I say. You can't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
ask any questions.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You need to leave now. You need to 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
leave as quietly as you can.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And don't take anything with you.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And every teacher

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
knew that this was serious but I remember specifically, Patty,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
these beautiful brown eyes just getting bigger and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
bigger as they connected with mine.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And she knew something was

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
terribly wrong.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And she looked at her students and she said "OK,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
let's do exactly what. Mr Knowles said.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Every classroom left.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Every student left. I think one of my colleagues did the second floor

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
because I don't remember getting up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
there. But I think within two to three minutes we had that classroom, that wing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
cleared.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You could hear a pin drop when everyone was leaving, that's how quiet everyone

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
was. The last teachers leaving the classroom wing and I decide

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm just going to stay put because I knew I was the only one that was in touch with the police.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And then all of a sudden, Andy comes around the corner.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
He's got two assistant principals with him and he's about fifteen feet

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
away. And he points the rifle at me.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm not much of a. I've never hunted.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
hunted. But it's a 30 ought 6 with a

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
scope. And he's got bullets wrapped around his waist

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and they're 2 to 3 inches long

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and I was. I got scared.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But I stayed calm. Andy's about 6' 2''

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
maybe 6'1''.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He's bigger than me, and without the gun I wouldn't want to take him on- I'm certainly not going to take

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
him on with the gun. And he said Mr Knowles I want you to get all the students

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in front of the building

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and I'm in a little bit of a quandry

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
here because as a counselor, I like want to save Andy. This guy who I talk with

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
every day. Some days he calls me Paul/

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We're kind of friends. But then we just cleared this building of

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
800 students. What's my priority here? Do I do what he wants

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
so that everyone stay safe?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I don't know where the answer came from.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But I just said to Andy. I'm sorry, Andy.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I can't do that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And I turn my back to him.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And I start to leave. Honestly thinking he might fire

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
his gun at me. Being a little ticked off that I didn't listen to him.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He didn't. And as I'm leaving the building I could

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
tell he was behind me and he was going to follow out the building. And when I get out of the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the building

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I realize oh my god. We have just sent

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
all these students into a cage.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Our evacuation area for fire drill is the softball field.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So now all these students are enclosed in this fenced-in area.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And then we got a student coming out of the building with a rifle.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
rifle. I feel if I start yelling,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
he'll come out quicker.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
quicker. Remembering the police officer said, "Do this quietly."

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So I take my crutches. And I just start waving frantically at the top of this hill looking down

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
on everyone and I'm hoping they understand.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Get! Leave! Run! He's coming out! Go!

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Go! But they're not moving. They don't know what the waving of the crutches is about.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And Andy's a couple steps away from coming outdoors so I go around the corner to be out of

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
his sight so I could keep waving.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But no one's moving and then I hear the gunshot

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and I see people running.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I just - I thought maybe

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
the shot was coming my way again but clearly after a couple seconds you know it didn't come your way

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and for me these I felt like I needed to get back in the building.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So I take a few minutes to get around to the front side and I don't know what happened I don't know where the shot went

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I decide to go back to the guidance office

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and I called the police again.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
This is Paul. What you want me to do? How can I help?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And they said, we don't know where Andy is, but he's back in the building.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Can you find him? Can you get him to pick up the phone? We need to talk to him. We want to negotiate with them.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I'm not sure how to do that. So I decide I'm just going to stay put and I just

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
from the guidance office I just keep calling the- the main office.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Pick up. Pick up, come on someone pick up, pick up.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I just kept trying, I kept trying.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Eventually the assistant principal John picked up.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Thank God. John, John you need to get Andy to pick up the phone the police

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
wanna talk to him.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Is Andy there and he said yeah Andy's here.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So Andy did pick up the phone.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
He did get into a discussion with the police. So in

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So in the meantime I call my link with the police department back and I say all right,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Andy's talking what he want me to do and they told me to get out of the building.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But at that point, I'm thinking I'm not sure I think this guidance office is pretty safe so I'm just going to

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
hang here for a few minutes and I actually go into my little office. And I crouch behind the

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
desk. And that's when it really hit me

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
because I have this 9 month old daughter back at my

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
house

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and her mom. And I'm wondering...

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
"Am I going to get to be a father still." And

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I just spent three minutes focused on my family. Missing them

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
them and feeling sad. Not scared. Just sad,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that this day was happening.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But after about three minutes of this I decided to leave the building

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and went out the loading dock and as I go up the loading dock, out from behind the dumpster,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
dumpster, state trooper. Point's his gun at me.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Thank God he had good training cause he didn't fire. And he ran up to me and he goes where's Andy? And

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
how do I get there so I gave him directions.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I got myself to safety still not really sure what happened. Well,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Well, Andy did surrender. He walked out the front of

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
building. I didn't see this, this is as told to me. And he lays

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
his gun down. And

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
lights a cigarette.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
As it turns out his shot was a warning shot.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Later that day I went back to that softball field.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And it was one of the most surreal and profound images that I will always remember.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Because in that softball field

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
are backpacks, shoes, papers, musical instruments.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
There's parts of the fence where it was literally run over by all the students and staff.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And what did have. What had happened

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
is that teachers in high heels were helped over

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the fence. We had a student in a wheelchair and he was carried over

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that fence. And while it looked like a U.F.O. had come along

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and plucked everyone out of that field and taken them away,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
what it really was

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Is that all those students and staff, somehow

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
by helping each other 

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
found their way to the safety of the community. To the safety

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
of the woods and the nearby homes and the nearby stores. So

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So what that image represents to me, as eerie as it is, is the fact

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
the fact that on that day, even though we didn't really know what to do,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we actually trusted each other, we took care of each other

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
other and in my mind, It was 800 heroes that somehow

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
worked together

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
on a day where we, a lot of people, could have gotten hurt.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
hurt. But instead, no one got hurt.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And I thank my 800 colleagues

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
on that day

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
that helped make it as positive as we could.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Thank you

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[applause]

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000
[cheering]
