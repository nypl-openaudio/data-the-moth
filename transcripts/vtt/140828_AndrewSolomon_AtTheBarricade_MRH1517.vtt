00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My first book

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
was about a group of Soviet

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
artists and how their lives changed

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
during glasnost. And the week it was published my

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
mother died.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And it was

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a terrible, terrible time for me. And I felt as

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
though words which I had always counted

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on had abandoned me. I couldn't write. I could

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
barely talk. None of it seemed to have any purpose or

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
any

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
value. And six weeks later I decided I had to get

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
away from home. And I thought I should go to some place

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that wasn't about my

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Mother. And I decided I would go to Moscow and see the artists

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'd been spending so much time with the previous few years. And I got there and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
for the first five days it was a kind of place

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of recovery. It was a place of feeling

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
apart from that great sorrow at least a little bit. And on the sixth day

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I was asleep in a squat on the outskirts of Moscow that I shared

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
with all of these

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
artists, and my phone

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
rang. And I answered it. And it was a

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
rather melodramatic photographer I knew, who said:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Andrew,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Gorbachev has been kidnapped. And I think we

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
will have civil war, so I cannot have dinner with you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
tonight. And I said, Vika 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Ivleva, how many times have I told you never to call me

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
before eleven

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
am. I went back to bed. They've been so much

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
intrigue in the Soviet system, none of it seemed very significant. And when I got up and went downstairs

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
some of the other artists who were living in the squat were there. The artists at that time

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
were mostly doing work that was highly ironic. It was work

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
full of strange in hidden meanings. And as an installation project two of them had

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
done something that included a bed on which the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
bed cover was a gigantic ten-foot Russian flag.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The Russian flag was still quite a radical symbol in those Soviet days.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And so when I went downstairs Kostya Zvezdochetov was sitting wrapped up in the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
big Russian flag. And I said, "I had the strangest call

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
from Vika Ivleva this morning. She called and said that Gorbachev had been

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
kidnapped." And Larisa Zvezdochetova said, "That's strange, someone called me 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
me today and said they'd seen tanks in the south of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Moscow." And I said, "That's odd." And someone said: "Let's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
turn on the television and see what's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
happening." So we turned on the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
television. Everyone had vodka in Russia or coffee, or some mix of the two.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And we went from channel to channel. And on every channel on the television there were

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Tchaikovsky ballets.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And Larisa said, "OK." She said, "I was not so frightened

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
about Gorbachev kidnapped. I was not so alarmed

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about tanks and south Moscow but I am terrified by these Tchaikovsky ballets.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
copy balance.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This is what they did, she explained. This is what they did when Stalin died. This is

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
what they did when Brezhnev was removed from power. This is what they do.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
When the news is so momentous that there is nothing to say.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So we all thought we should try to find out what was happening. And we made a few calls and we decided

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
A lot seem to be happening around the Russian parliament building. And so we went

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
down there on the Metro. And we got out at the station Barrikadnaya. Called

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Barrikadnaya because that's where the barricades

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
were built in the original 1917 revolution. And when we

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
got there, as we were leaving, there was the woman who sweeps the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
station and there were always these women. Hundreds of thousands of people pouring through and they were sweeping

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the dust and they never said anything and they were bent over.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And we got to this station and she was standing erect and pointing with the broom and saying,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
"Go to the demonstration. Go at once to the demonstration" to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
everyone who came

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
out. So we went to the demonstration.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And as we went we had to pick our way in between construction debris because at that point

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
everything in Moscow was under construction and none of it was ever finished. And in general it was

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
a terrible nuisance.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But in this instance, it turned out to be a great thing because as we got closer, we saw

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that people were dragging things from these construction sites to build barricades

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
around the Russian parliament

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
building. And there was a woman, a rather elegant woman in high heels who is standing just

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
near the edge of the barricade and asking, "Excuse me, but do you know how

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to operate a bulldozer?"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 [laughter]

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We helped with the building of the barricades. There was someone who had managed to jumpstart a crane

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
who had clearly, never before used a crane.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
He would pick things up and get them up into the air. And they would

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
teeter there and then they would go down someplace else.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
There was a woman, a sort of big Soviet Russian woman who was standing there

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and trying to direct the whole thing and pointing where the crane should go and telling people where to drag things.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And yelling at the top of her lungs.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And at that time, in the Soviet Union, it was quite trendy

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to have clothing with Western writing on it and people often had it but didn't

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
know what their clothes said. And she was wearing a T-shirt

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that said "I'd rather be playing tennis." We

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
decided

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We decided to go back down to the Parliament that night with a whole group.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We'd called all our friends, there were thirty or maybe forty of us. And someone said, but there are so

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
many people down there what if we get separated? And Kostya and Andrusha said,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
"We'll take the big flag bedspread. We'll nail it to a pole. And

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
we'll have it and if we get separated, we can meet at the flag," which we all

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
thought was a good idea.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So we went down there. And we helped a little more with building the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
barricades and, just as we were getting ready to go back home, a woman

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to us and she said, "We have a giant helium balloon. We're blowing it up right now.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
now. We're blowing it up because we want to show where we are. And we want to

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the flag

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
so that everyone knows we're here. And you have the biggest Russian flag

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I have ever seen." She said,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
She said, "Will you give us your flag so that we can fly it over the parliament building?"

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And Andrusha said, "Kostya?" and Kostya said,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
"OK." So we left the flag.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Day Two.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We went down again. By now the barricades were fully built. There were people milling around.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Across the street from the barricades were

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the tanks that had pulled up during the night and in the early part of the morning. And there were soldiers,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
soldiers, very young soldiers on the tanks. And we went over to talk

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We asked them where they came from and whether they'd been to Moscow before.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And how long they'd been in the military. And then

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the artists would say, "If you

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
"If you need to fire tonight; if you're told to fire on the demonstration,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
it's us. That's who you'd

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
be shooting at. It's us. 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And if you decide not to do it, and you want to come over, we'll find you a place to

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
live and we'll protect you." And we gave them bread and chocolate

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and sausages.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And then we went back to where everyone was milling around outside the parliament,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
demonstrating, though no one knew quite what it was they were demonstrating for.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Someone had to use the loo and someone pointed out that a musicologist

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I knew, Tanya ?Degenco?, had an apartment which looked right

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
over the Russian parliament building and, which was in fact inside the barricades.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And so we went up to Tanya's apartment and she said, "I did

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
not imagine that my apartment would become the toilet of the resistance.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But if this is how I can help,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 I'm all for it."

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Someone pointed out that I had a Western passport and I could check into an international hotel.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And if I did so, I could maybe get some other kind of news. And

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I thought I'd try it. So I went to a Western hotel and I, in fact, could

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
get CNN. And I watched for a little while and the announcer said,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
"Unbeknownst to the protesters gathered outside the Russian parliament building, there are

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
troops massing to the north of Moscow who seem to be headed in their direction." So

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I picked up the phone and I called Tanya ?Degenko? and I said, "Unbeknownst

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to the protesters outside the parliament building,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
there are troops massing to the north of Moscow who appear to be mobilizing in

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
the direction of the parliament." And Tanya said, "Hold on a

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
minute," and then I heard this incredible, loud

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
bellowing sound. I couldn't figure out what it was. And she came back and

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
she picked up the phone and I said "Tanya, what was that?" And she said

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
"Now they know."

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That night, we were outside

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the building, talking to all the other people who were there. The rest

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
of the intelligentsia and everyone else who'd gathered.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And we heard the barricade being pulled apart. And we thought, oh no, the barricade is

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
being destroyed and we went running to see what was happening.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
But it wasn't that the whole barricade was being destroyed. Boris Yeltsin was

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
riding in on his tank. To give his historic

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
speech about democracy and about the future of Russia. And he

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
came in and he was applauded. And everyone was thrilled. And he stood on the

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
parliament steps

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And he began saying, "I speak to you today, under the

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
banner of Russia." And Kostya and Andrusha nudged each other

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and said, "It's our banner.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It's our flag."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
The third day.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The third day we got up and we decided to go up to Svetlanskaya near the American Embassy because

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that was the place where three people had been killed the night before.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The only casualties of this unfolding drama. And

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
when we got there. It was such a Russian scene. There were flowers strewn on the ground. There

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
were old women crying. There were people talking about the nature of tragedy. And we were all standing

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
around and, suddenly,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
a young man came running up. He had a tweed cap clutched in his hand

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and wire-rimmed glasses and he looked like a 1917 revolutionary. Or like the

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
student in a Chekhov play.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And he said, "Hurry up. Come at once. There are tanks approaching the outer barricade. We have to go

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
defend the outer barricade."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Well, there had been tanks endlessly approaching and they had always just parked across the street. And so we walked

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
up to the outer barricade quite far away, in fact, from the parliament building. And we arranged

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
ourselves in front of it holding hands.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And two minutes later a column of tanks rolled up.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And they stopped about three feet away from us.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And it was still the Cold War. And I had grown up thinking that there was nothing

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
more frightening in the world

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
than a Soviet tank coming up to you. And the soldier

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
on the front tank said, "We have been given unconditional orders to destroy

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
this barricade. If you move out of the way...we don't need to hurt anyone but

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
if you won't move out of the way, we'll have no choice but to run you down.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And the artists I was with said,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
"Give us just one minute.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here." And the soldier on the front

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
tank crossed his arms

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the artists launched into a description of what

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
freedom was. And they said you're very young. You don't remember the Stalin era.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Let me tell you what it was like.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It was terrible. They said you don't remember what it was like when Brezhnev ran things, but

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that was terrible, too. And they said, "You say that you're just following orders,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
but you're making a choice

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to follow those orders and you could make another choice instead."

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And they launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy, of a kind

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that those of us who live in democracies mostly couldn't

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000
master. And when they finished, we stood there sneezing, wet,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
cold, bedraggled, and the soldier on the front tank

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
just stared at us for a full minute. And at the end of a minute he said,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
"What you've said is true and we must bow to the will of the people.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
If you'll clear us enough space to turn around, we'll go back and we'll leave

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
you your barricade.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And we all stepped aside.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And the tanks made U-turns, which is not so easy for a tank.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And they drove off the way that they had come.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And we all embraced one another.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And then, I had to go to the airport because my visa

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
expired that day. And I

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
got in a cab and I was on my way to the airport when

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the news came on.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
The putsch had failed. Yeltsin

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
was in charge. Russia was to be a democracy.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And I thought that language had come back for me. I thought I would be

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
able to write and talk again because what I had always hoped

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
but never believed to be true was that if you could only

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
speak clearly enough about important things, you could

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
change the world. And I thought

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
how revolutions occur because

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
of tiny acts

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
by many people. And when I got to Sherametyevo, I managed to get a phone

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and I called my friends, and Kostya answered the phone, and I said,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
"Is it true? Is it really true?" And he said,"Yes." And I could hear

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
the people dancing and singing in the background. And I said, "Kostya, do you

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
think we had anything to do with it?"

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And he said, "Of course we did." He said, "We helped to build the barricades.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
We stood outside that parliament building. We turned around that column

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
of tanks." And then

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
he paused, and he said, "But it was my flag."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Thank you.
