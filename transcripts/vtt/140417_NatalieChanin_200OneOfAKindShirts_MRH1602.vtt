00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I am from a small town in northwest Alabama. And, in that place, and at

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the time I was growing up, um, it was about

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
buttoning yourself and, being tucked in, and hiding things away. Because

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
although, um, you know, all the farms in the textile mills, on the outside,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
just on the edge of those mills was Mother Nature. And, she was always so

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
close just right to that edge of all that cultivation. And

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so, in my part of the world, um, you know, a house that's left

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
alone or not cared for can really melt down into this

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
fertile wet, uh, green mass where

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
animals and kudzu wait to grow into the buildings.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so, um, you know, people hoe and they cut things back.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They keep it pruned, and they, uh, watch, and wait for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that little slip that's going to come through.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, uh, there's this moment in my childhood where I'm walking down the stairs of the church

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and my...um, a friend of the family is coming up the stairs and she looks at my

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
cousin Pam and she goes, "Pam, you have just grown up to be the most

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
beautiful young woman.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Just stunning."  And, she looks over at me and she goes,  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
"And Natalie, you're so..so...exotic."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[laughter]

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And, you know,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
sitting here today, I look back and I know that what she was trying to say

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
was this.. there felt there's this little piece of that outside

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that she could smell underneath, and it scared her.  

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And so, you know, I hit the ground running just as fast as I could

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to get away from

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
being tied up. And, nature, and I tried

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to run towards exotic and what I thought 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I could find in the world. And I traveled around the world and I came

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
back again.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And I learned how to, uh...I did things I never

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
imagined I could have done as a rur...a girl rural

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Alabama. But, there was a night I arrived, uh, back in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
New York in the year 2000. I was, uh, moving away from a marriage

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that was gone wrong.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I was questioning and not finding answers. And

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that night when I arrived, it was snowing outside. And, I was really cold

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and, uh, lost. And all of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the...um, everything was raw.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I was invited one night to what I deemed this really fancy fashion party,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
like only New York City can do. Right?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And, so I had been wallowing in my self-

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
discovery or you could call it self-pity during this time. And I was

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
pretty broke. [laughs]

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And, I didn't have anything to wear to this party. So, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I took a t-shirt out of my...my backpack and I cut it up. And, I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
kind of pinned together on my body. And I sewed it back together again with needle and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
thread. And, so I went to the party that night, and the strangest thing happened.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That people would, like, see me across the room, and they would walk across the room, and kind of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
touch my body, which, uh, people in New York City

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
don't really do, you know. [laughter] You know, in the south, you hug

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
people whether you like them or

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
not. [laughter]

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But, um, people in New York City don't really do that. But people were touching me, and they were

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
asking, you know, what do you...What is that? What do you have on?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And, so the next morning, I, uh, I woke up. And, you know, I was really

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
proud that people had liked my shirt that I had found this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
approval from the fancy fashion folk. But, what really struck me that morning when I

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
woke up was that, although I had been a designer and a stylist

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
for really long time, it had also

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
been equally as long since I had made something with my own two hands. And I felt so, uh,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
moved to get up that morning and make another t-shirt. And so, I made another t-shirt and another

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
t-shirt. And, I just kept making shirts, and I kept wearing them, and people would stop me on

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the street and they would touch me.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And, in the middle of all this making and touching, I had this vision that I wanted to see these

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
200 one-of-a-kind cut up t-shirts

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
sewn back together again and laid out on the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
floor. And, so I started going around to manufacturers the New York. These

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
bags of Salvation Army/Goodwill collected throwaway things that

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
were cut apart and, um,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
you know they thought I was a crazy bag lady.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And, so, uh, rejection after rejection (Uh, excuse me.)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Nobody really wanted me to, uh, to help me make these shirts. And, so I'm standing on the street

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
corner on Eighth and 38th one afternoon, and I'm looking down at the t-shirt, and I'm like,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's a quilting stitch. And, I realized in that moment that I was going to have

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
to go home

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
because all of the ladies who quilted with my grandmothers were still

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
there in Alabama quilting, and I was like:

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This is such a great idea. In my mind, I thought, "This is gonna be

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
so great. I'm gonna to go home. They're gonna to love to do this. This is gonna

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
be so easy!"

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And so, I write a proposal. I raise some money. I call my aunt down in Alabama.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Explain the project to her, and I say, "I'm looking for a house that can be project headquarters. Can you

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
help me find something?" And she calls me back a couple of days later and she's like "I have the

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
perfect house"

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
house." Um, it's...the house is in, um, just behind

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
my mother's childhood home. It's built by my father's father for his very

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
best friend. It is perfect, right? Exclamation mark.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And so, in December, I rent a car and I drive down

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
to Alabama, uh, stopping at every thrift store along the way, and buying all these t-shirts.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And, on December 23rd, I arrive in Alabama with a

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
friend. And, you can see the house from the road. Right?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
She had forgotten to tell me that the house had been abandoned for the last five years. [laughs]

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That no one had really lived in the house since that time, and there's like a

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
little path that goes around the back of the house that used to be a driveway. And

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
we drive around to the back door, and my aunt and my mother have cut a

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
hole through all of the nature in to the back door with a

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
chainsaw. And, my dream,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
my project is really just an old mattress thrown on a 1970s 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
vinyl floor, in a house that smells of old

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
chicken bones and, 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
shut up, and animals and things that live on the edges of

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
places. Right? So, I go to bed that night, and, um,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I'm laying on this mattress on the floor, and I just start to cry. And I

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
cry, and I cry, and I cry some more. And, you know, I just think I spent

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
my whole life running away from this place

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that, um, you know, traveling the world, doing these things, and all

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
of this comes

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to, you know, laying on on the floor in the middle of the night, waiting for

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
ghosts or kudzu to crawl up through the floor boards and, and

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
uh, lay down next to me. And, the whole night, I can't

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
stop looking around me, because all I can think about are all of the heat-

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
seeking snakes that are in the house, right, as soon as I'm still, I'm gonna

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
feel that

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
cold thing slither up next to me and lay down.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, some time about, uh,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
uh, you know, in the very early morning, I guess, I...I close my eyes and I fell asleep for

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
a minute. And I wake up, and it was the most beautiful crisp, clear

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
December morning. Uh, the light in Alabama at this time is absolutely

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
beautiful. It was Christmas Eve,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and I get up out of the bed, and go over to the kitchen, and clean off a little place

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and make my tea, and I sit down on this borrowed stool. And, I look around the room and

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I realize that, you know, it may have, uh, 1970s vinyl on the

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
floor, but the walls are completely covered with heart pine paneling.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And, I don't know if you know this, but these really old broad heart pine boards from

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the south were made from the Longleaf Pine trees which were called the giants

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
of the South. And so they're hundreds and hundreds of years old, these trees, before they make

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
these

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
boards. And, so I think, I'm just going to clean one board, and um, you know, just see, 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
what the wood looks like. So, I go over and I clean this one board, and it is

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
sooo beautiful. I mean the wood is spectacular, right

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
spectacular, right. And, I stand there, and I look, and I think, "OK, I

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I can clean one more board. So, I clean one more board, and when I finish with

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that board, I realize that I can...do have the resolve within me, maybe,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to clean one more.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And, so, you know, throughout the day, board by board, I

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
move through the room. And, by the end of the day, the sun is setting back behind the kitchen

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
there, I sit back down on the stool, and I've cleaned the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
entire, uh, room. And, I think, you know, I think I can do this.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So, the next morning I get up, and I um, I get a phone, and I start calling

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
these women who used to quilt with my grandmothers. Right? And, I'm like: This is gonna be

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
so great. You're going to love it. It's like New York City Fashion and

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Vogue, and everything that you could dream of...and they so don't love it. [laughter]

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
They could care less. You know?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
They talked to me about their kids, and their grandkids, and common acquaintances,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and church, and their gardens. And, you know, I show them the shirts.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And one of the ladies says you know, "My grandmother would say about that, 'Honey,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
those stitches are so big that you could get your toenails caught up in 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
'em.'" [laughter]

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And they laugh, and they talked to me about planting turnip greens, and the importance

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
of that.  But...what...

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Turnip greens are really important. My aunt once asked

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
me...I was telling her about a boy that I was kind of interested in, and she said, "Yeah, but can he grow turnip

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
greens? (Laughs) It's true. (Laughs)

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, um, but what I did find out from having these conversations with

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the community of my childhood was that the mills had closed down. And that there

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
were women and men who were out of work, and maybe they would want this work. And, so I

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
ran a little ad in the paper that said "Part-time hand-sewing and quilting."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And about 60 women called, and about, uh, 20 women stuck. And, we sewed the 200 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
one-of-a-kind shirts, and I brought them to New York Fashion Week. And, we sent out a little catalog.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And, the first person to walk to the door is Julie Gillheart, who was then the buyer

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
from Barney's New York. And, Julie swoops back in a few days later with her buyers, and

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000
they look at all the t-shirts and they go, "We'll have 12 like this, and 12 like this, and 12 like this.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And I'm like, wait...wait a minute...

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
These are one-of-a-kind shirts, you know, like, wait, how are we gonna make twelve shirts like this

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
this that says, you know, Smith Family Reunion from Roanoke

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Virginia. I'm like...this is nu...

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And, they said, "Just make something like it." And, um, we made

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
them, and

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
um, uh, we brought them to New York. We took

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the orders. Julia Gillheart and Sally Singer from Vogue

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
went out into the world, and told everybody about the work we were

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
doing. Um, all the t-shirts had been made with all of the seams on the

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
inside out. That night, when I

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
sewed that first shirt back together again, um,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I had, uh, turned everything to the outside, so it was raw and exposed, kind of

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
like I was in that moment of my life. And,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
this style, this idea of everything being turned on the outside, has really

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
become our signature style. So, it's fifteen years later and I'm still at

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
home. We have about 32 women who still sew these

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
shirts in the field by hand, everything completely sewn by hand. We have, uh,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
about 40 of us that work in our studio. We have just opened a new

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
machine sewn textile factory in hopes of recreating

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
this community of my childhood. We have a café...um...

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
People come from all over the world now to Florence, Alabama, to sit with us, to sew with us...

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
eat with us, to laugh, to tell stories

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Um, and I live at home.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And, um, you know, some days it feels like I'm still cleaning heart pine boards,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
board by board. And, I live really close to nature. And I can

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
sometimes feel it coming out of the edges and up around and into my

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
life, but, um, I guess I kind of like it that way. So,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So, thank you.
