00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I had this really, really, really great childhood. I grew up in a

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
wonderful home with both my parents and they gave me every

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
single thing I could ever imagine. It was, you know, really elaborate

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
holidays and great

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
vacations. And just everything, they wanted to expose me to the world. I mean they

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
had me out there, uh, showing horses. You know,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
riding - horseback riding.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was the only brother at the stable, out there riding a horse. That's what I was doing when I

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
was ten years old. They wanted to make sure that I knew the world was my oyster 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I could be or do anything I wanted. It was a really really nice perfect

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
upbringing and, you know, they had a plan in mind when they gave me this, uh, upbringing,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that plan was for me to go to college, then go to law school and go off and get

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a really good job and the really good job in my parents' mind was

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for me to be president of the United States. Um, that's right - the guy who

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
was Barack Obama before he was Barack Obama is standing here before you right now.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I was supposed to be the first black president of the United States. That was the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
plan. And so I bought in this plan, it was a good plan, right,  who doesn't want to be president.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I went off to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
college, um, um, majored in international affairs, went off to law

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
school after that and graduated from law school and then had this opportunity

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to run, uh, an inner city school in the city of Chicago and while

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
being an educator or taking that role wasn't really part of the plan,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I realized that it could really help me. When

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I started pursuing this political career. I mean who's not going to vote for

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the guy

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
who stands there in the ad with his hands on his hips looking like Superman, in front of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
a classroom of kids.  You know -

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You know - "Vote Tim McCain - He changes the world.  He educates kids."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So I figured OK. I'll take this job and, um, you know, maybe it'll

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you know lead me to some other things that follow along with the plan.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
One day I was walking into the school, it was pretty early,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
around 7, 7:30 in the morning and I, uh, unlocked the door and there

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
was a kid sitting outside waiting to get in. His name was Keith.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I, I said you know, "What are you doing?" He's like, "Oh, I'm, you know, working here painting during the summer."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Okay, so, come on in. And Keith certainly was painting with a bunch

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
of the other students at the school that summer. Uh, he would stay really late.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The next day he showed up very early, stayed really

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
late and the summer eventually melted into the school year and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Keith was still coming to school really really early and staying at school really really late and I just figured

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Okay this guy just you know likes

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
school, um. Although I didn't understand how anyone could like school that much. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But I started kind of keeping an eye on him, you know, because there was something up with

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
this, with this young man. And eventually

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
he started talking to me and having conversation. Throughout the course of the day, he'd stop by my office and say "what

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
was up", you know, he talked to me after school and then he started, you know,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
doing things like asking me if he could borrow a couple

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
bucks and I'd give him the money. I really didn't pay much attention to the reasons

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
why he needed the money. In fact I really wasn't all that interested in knowing because I didn't really

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
didn't really want to, you know,  know that much. Right? I just, here's the money. You know you stay in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
your world, it's cool, I'm in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
mine. You go right ahead with your business. Step by step

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
though, you know, he started asking for more money, more frequently,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
he started hanging out in my office a bit more, he started talking to me more coming out of his shell and I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
was coming out of my shell a bit with

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
him. And one day I asked him, you know, what did he need this money for? And he said, oh I've gotta go do my laundry. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I thought, this kid's lying to me. What, what, you know, fifteen year old has to go

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and do his laundry, needs money, to go and do his laundry? Um, but

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I gave him the money anyway and you know just said okay, you know, go do what you have to do. One night I got a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
call from Keith, um, and he was in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
hysterics and, um, he asked me if I would help him. If I'd

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
get him from his house

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
house. And I said "sure, you know, what's what's going on what's wrong" and he said, "my mom just died."

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So I go over to his house, and it's not a house, it's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
an apartment over a liquor store.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And I walk in and it's pitch black in the apartment, just the light from the streetlamps coming in

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the window. And I see...from that light I

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
see garbage 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
bags. Some  bags with garbage in them and other bags with his

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
stuff and I'm...no lights, not because he had turned off the lights

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
because the electricity was

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
off. There was no power in this apartment and it was cold.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And he was

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
just in hysterics because his mother had just died. She had been battling, unbeknownst

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to me, drug addiction. And she lost that battle. And the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
drugs won and she died and so we grabbed Keith's stuff in the garbage bags,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
put them in my car

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and then I was faced with "well, where do we go?"

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So I said to him, you know, "you got a friend you can stay with?", and he 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
said sure" and we drop him off at a friend's house and I went back home to

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
my house. Um, the next day, Keith was at

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
school.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And, we talked and tried to work through where he was going to live and we

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
found another place for him to stay. Temporarily.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And then, you know, I started getting closer to Keith, we started talking more... obviously this kind of experience,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
you know, brings people together. And so you know, we would, you know, go out - I'd take him out to eat after

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
school or we would go to the movies or we'd go to a basketball game or something

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you know like that. And every time after

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
after, we'd, you know, go to dinner or go to the game, I would drop him

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
off at someone else's house and I would go home to mine.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
One

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
day Keith and I were sitting in the car after we had gone out or something and

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
we were trying to work through where he was going to go and you know, he just looked

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
at me and he said, "Why can't I just live with you?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Why can't you be my dad?"

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
At that moment I thought,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Are you crazy? Of course you can't live with me!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Of course I can't be your

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
dad. You don't fit into this plan. I'm going to be the first black president of the United

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
States. You can't move in with me. I had

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
put Keith in this box. This box that said: 'Poor Black Boy Inside - Handle With

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
inside handle with care." And I put that box far away from me.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I didn't allow myself to get close to that

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
box, to get close to Keith. All of that went through my

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
head in a matter of seconds. Quite literally. And

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
when I came out of this kind of fog and he was still sitting there in the car

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
looking at

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
me, asking if he could live with

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
me, asking if I could be his dad. And I looked at him. And

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I said "yes. Yes, you

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
can live with me. Yes, I will be your dad." And at

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that moment,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I changed. I felt right.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I just felt right

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
right. Now...what I

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
should have felt was terrified. Because when Keith

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
moved into my house... It wasn't like, you know, one

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
elephant coming through - it was a herd of elephants.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
He took over. As a, as a matter of fact, when I met Keith and he moved

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in I had a full head of

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
hair. We're talking giant afro. From the sixties, seventies afro. You know what

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I'm saying? He ran it all away. It was really really

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
really hard, living with him. He had been

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
used to living by himself. Living on his own. I had been used to living by myself.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Living on my own.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
He, while living a life that was like an adult as a child,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
he all of a sudden had an opportunity to be a kid again. And I

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
had lived this life like a kid with a bank account and all of a sudden I

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
had to be an adult.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Keith

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and I managed to make it

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
through our time living together. He calls

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
me dad. I refer to him as my son.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
He graduated from high school and he went on to

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Georgetown University, my alma mater.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
He graduated from Georgetown. Moved back home to

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Chicago and right now, at this very moment, he works

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
with me in a network of charter public high schools that I started

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
called Urban Prep. He's a teacher. I started Urban Prep

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
because I wanted to make sure that all the Keiths in the world were taken care of.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He works at Urban Prep because he wants to be a part of changing lives

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
like his life was changed. When Keith and I live together

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to this very day, what I wanted to do was make sure that he had a life that was

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
filled with love.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The life I had when I was growing up.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
People always say to me.... Oh,Tim, you changed Keith's life.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And I say to them, "he changed mine."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
As we walked down

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that road of him going from being a boy

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to becoming a man. While I was helping him grow, from boyhood to manhood,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
he was helping me grow. He was helping me become a better

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
man. A

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
little while ago I got a text message from Keith.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And the text message read, "Our family's at the basketball game.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Where are you? You should be here."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And I smiled because Keith was berating me. And

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
then I got a little teary because as I looked down at that text message

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I realized that Keith

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
written: Our Family. Our family.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Thank you.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
you.
