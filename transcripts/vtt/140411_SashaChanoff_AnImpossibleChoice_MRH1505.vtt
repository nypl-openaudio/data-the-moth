00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm looking out a hotel suite window in the capital of Congo

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in the middle of Africa.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There are bullet marks on the buildings, out there, because war is raging.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But it's nighttime and quiet. There's a nasty

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
cockroach infestation in the kitchen and a putrid smell in the air.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I've turned the T.V. volume up loudly because the Congolese government has bugged

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
our

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
room.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I turn and face

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Shaka. She's a woman from Kenya with the brown skin of the coastal people

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and thick black hair and intense dark eyes. Tears are welling in her eyes

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and she's pleading with me. "SASHA. We have to take these people

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
along with the rest.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If we don't, they'll die here, and their blood will be on our hands. Please.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You have to trust me." I'm facing a terrible decision

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I'm afraid no matter what I do people are going to be

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
killed.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
A month earlier in Kenya, my boss David---at the International Organization

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
for Migration where we worked--called me into his office. He handed me

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a list with one hundred twelve names on

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it and told me he was sending me into the Congo, on a rescue mission.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The job was to evacuate one hundred and twelve massacre survivors.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He warned me really explicitly that under no circumstances could I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
include anybody else on that list. If I did, we would fail to get

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
anyone out and they would all

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
die.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
David knew because he'd spent the past six months in the Congo evacuating people.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'd met one teenage girl that he pulled out--she had these nervous eyes-- and she

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
told me that the killing started when the President of Congo went on

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
T.V. and said that all people of the Tutsi tribe are the enemy and need to be hunted

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
down and exterminated.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It was an extension of the role of Rwandan genocide in

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
ways. This teenage girl went into hiding that day but had to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
eventually come out to look for food and as she was sneaking around town she saw a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
mob chased down and catch another woman, and they put a tire over her body pinning

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
her arms to her side and doused her in gasoline and set her on fire.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
They were killing people in terrible ways because Tutsis were seen as the scapegoats for the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Congo's problems.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This teenage girl had lost her own parents, but she had four brothers who were still alive and they

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
were on the list that David handed

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
me.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
David also warned me about Shaka. She'd been on every previous mission with him.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But he told me that I couldn't trust her, that she always tried to include additional people and I had to stop

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
her from doing that.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Shaka and I flew into the Congo and we rented a car and a driver and went to the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
safe compound where the hundred and twelve were gathered.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
These big black gates swung open as our car drove into this two acre

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
compound with ten foot walls and jagged shards of glass topping the walls.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
There were guards with AK- 47's slung at their sides standing around.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
A one brick story building (a one story building) was in the middle and a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
large tent off to the side and latrines on another side.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Somebody saw Shaka and all the sudden there was a mob around our car and they were pushing it up and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
down and chanting her name and I remember David telling me that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
people are going to go crazy with

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
relief when they see you because they think they're going to die there. And when they see you they'll

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
know there's another flight. But it felt really scary and out of control for me

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because they were away more people than one hundred and twelve on our

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
list.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We sat a table up on the top of a little hill and the crowd gathered below and I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
called people up one at a time and I took their name and their birth date and their photo

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and I told them we'd be flying them out in a few days time; I had to give this information to the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Congolese immigration officials.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I got really excited when I saw the four brothers of that teenage girl come up.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
When

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
we were done in trying to leave a guy who was working in the compound said " before you leave you

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
have to go into that tent over there and look at the people who just came

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
in and I thought, I don't want to see anybody else, we can't take them, so why even look.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But my feet were walking towards the tent as I was thinking that and I stepped inside

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and it was like time stopped.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was really hot in that tent and I remember the sweat trickling down

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the small of my back. But what struck me was how

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
completely quiet it was--which seemed impossible because there

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
were thirty two widows and orphans standing and sitting in that tent.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
A guy who brought us in leaned into me and said, " They were in a prison camp for sixteen

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
months where most of their family members were executed we don't know how they survived."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
They all looked traumatized and imaciated and they had these

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
hollow stares like there was nothing behind their eyes.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Shaka leaned down to a little girl holding a doll and said, "Let me see

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
your doll".  And all the sudden the doll's eyes popped open

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and its tongue lolled out of its

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
mouth and we realized it was an infant child that looked more dead than

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
alive.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I went over to a thirteen year old boy and said, " What's your name?" And

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
another smaller boy grabbed his hand and said,  "He doesn't talk anymore, I talk for

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
him". That 13 year old had been brutalised so badly he just

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
stopped speaking. Shaka and I left, and that night, in the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
hotel room she was holding the list of widows and orphans and begging me to take them.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I held the list of a hundred twelve and I said, "We

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
can't.' But I wondered,  "Can I live with myself

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
if we leave these widows and orphans here and they're

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
killed?"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
No, I didn't think so but could I live with myself if we tried to take them

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and we failed to get everybody out and they all

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
died? No.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And then I thought about who Shaka was, she had like this clear  moral orientation,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
she did what was right in her heart and wasn't concerned about personal gain

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
or

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
recognition. And then I wondered, "who am I"?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
My great grandmother had come to the U.S. as a refugee fleeing anti-Semitism in Russia and she was

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
a widow who raised four orphans or four children on her own.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I've been working with refugees since graduating from college six years earlier but nothing had prepared me

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
for this. And then Shaka I said words that changed me,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"Sasha, we're humanitarians. We're here on the ground now. If

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
we don't do this these people will be forgotten and they'll die here. This is up to us.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It's our

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
decision". And in that moment I

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
trusted her.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So I called David. And he got really angry when we told him what we wanted to do he said,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"Listen, I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen. You have to tell the Congolese immigration

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
authorities and then they're going to include their own people on your list. And then the last minute,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
maybe even on

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the plane they'll pull your people off and you won't get anybody out. You can't do this".

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And I said, "David I get it, but we have to try. And he was quiet and

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
then I heard him say, "OK, and here's what you have to do. This is a U.S. rescue mission

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
so get the U.S. ambassador's approval. I try it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We got the U.S. ambassador's approval. And then, on the last night as the sun was setting

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
we went to see the head of Congolese immigration (a stocky man with

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
beady eyes who'd already told us how much he hated Tutsis).

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
When we told him we were taking the widows and orphans, he said that he had seven additional people

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
we had to take. And we said that's fine. And then he pulled out this whole

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
new list and said he also wanted to take all these other people,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and we said," we can't". And we argued with them. And we even tried to bribe 'em. But as

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
we were leaving all they said was, "I'm in charge here. I say

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
who leaves and who stays.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We'll just see what happens tomorrow."

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Those words terrified

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
me.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Back in the hotel we realize we had another big problem- we had too many people

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
for our flight. But then we thought that the children all looked so emaciated 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that we could change the birth dates and make all the four and three year olds less than two

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and in that way we'd free up enough seats.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So I spent the night doing that and at three AM,as I tried to close my eyes,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I couldn't sleep I was so wired with exhaustion and fear

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and the uncertainty of it all. I thought, "Have we just condemned everyone

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to death with this

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
decision?"

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
A few hours later I went and got four buses and I had four armed

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
guards per bus and I went to the safe compound. And we started loading everybody on and the people who weren't

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
coming started yelling. And one man grabbed me and he pulled my face close to his and he said,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
"Sasha, you have to take me with you! Look at my face. I'm a Tutsi. I'll be killed here".

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But we couldn't take him or so many others. And their cries

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
faded into the distance as our busses pulled

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
out. And now my heart jumped in my throat because this was the most dangerous part of the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
entire

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
mission. The Congalese government had told us that they would let us do this but

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
unofficially they didn't want us to succeed. And I worried that maybe a mob would attack our bus.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Or maybe gunmen would start shooting from around a corner. Hundreds of thousands of people had lost

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
their lives already and no one would notice a few

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
more. An hour later we finally pulled into the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
airport and we stopped fifty feet away from the plane and I thought," There's the plane. Let's just get

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
everybody on that plane."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Congolese immigration police hustled me and Shaka off the buses and.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Then they started checking people using the documentation we had given. And as the widows and

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
orphans came down they stopped them.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And I had this terrible thought, "Oh my God, these people are witnesses to terrible atrocities

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and the Congolese immigration police aren't going to let them leave because they don't want them talking about what they've

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
seen". I 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
thought," Everything that David said is coming true right now". And I felt so helpless and I looked

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
around for Shaka and she was talking to the head of Congolese immigration and waving her

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
arms and the seconds tick by. And then they

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
let them off the bus. And they boarded the plane and we all boarded the plane.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
stepped on last. And the cabin had turned into a furnace because the plane had

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
been sitting on the tarmac for a couple of hours. And it was so

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
packed with people. They were so many children sitting on laps of adults.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
The door shut behind me. And I felt the plane engines rumble to life.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And cool air came into the cabin. And we started down the runway. And we lifted off the

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
ground.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I'd imagined that in that moment people would erupt into cheers

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
of joy because they were finally

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
safe. But when I looked everyone was crying for the people we

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
had left behind.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It was at once the most joyous and heartbreaking moment.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And in that moment I thought about Shaka pleading with me in the hotel.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And I was so

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
thankful. We couldn't get everyone out but we got those on our list

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
out and those widows and orphans and they were the worst off. I looked at the

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
tiny infant. And there was a thirteen year old

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
boy. And there were the four brothers who are going to be reuniting with their teenage

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
sister

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
soon. And as their eyes met mine I felt

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
this incredible sense of connection and shared humanity

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
sink into the deepest core of who I am. And that feeling

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
has motivated and inspired me ever since.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
applause

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
you.
