00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So I spent my entire adult life

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
searching.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Searching for meaning, wondering

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
meaning, wondering why it is that we're even alive.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I say my entire adult life because that hasn't always been the case.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I grew up in the western suburbs of Melbourne and I can tell you that the only searching that was going on was for the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the next party

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
next party. And the only questioning,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"Are we drinking beer, or bourbon and coke?"And this all changed

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
all changed at

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
-ged at eighteen years old. I was taken on a four day Outward Bound

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
style hike

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I'm embarrassed, really embarrassed

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to tell you that I actually, I hated it. I hated it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that hike almost broke me. I wasn't in good enough

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I wasn't in good enough shape, and at the end of each day I just felt beaten

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and weak and incompetent. There was

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There was only

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There was only one consolation. On the last night

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we got sent out. Those of you familiar with Outward Bound will know about the solo.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We got sent out to be on our own for the night. We got sent out with no sleeping bags, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
no food, 'part save for a bag of flour

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
flour. And no water. And a box of matches. And you had to survive the night.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the night. Now a lot of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now a lot of the other guys that were on this course couldn't make it. They scurried back

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
back to the main camp during the night. And that night I fell in

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I fell into my element. I discovered this, this peace that

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
peace that, take everything away and I can be OK. And that night

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And that night I actually, I felt this connection. I felt overco- overcome by this connection.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
By this connection and for one of the first times in my life

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I actually felt at home

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
home. For the next decade I, I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
...I've...I've drifted in and out of actually, of feeling, chasing that connection do-

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that connection down. And periods of being lost where I would switch back

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
switch back to my old ways. In April

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
1997 found me once again lost.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And whenever I've had that feeling before I did what I had always

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
had always done. And I reached for my backpack and my hiking boots. I'd

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'd heard about an island called Hinchinbrook island off the coast of the Great Barrier

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Barrier Reef in the northeast of Australia. And, what I'd heard about Hinchinbrook Island is

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Hinchinbrook Island is that it was this amazing wilderness island. And to get across you have

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you have to catch a ferry boat across. It takes a couple of hours.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And when I say ferry boat, right. For those of you that have cruised the Greek islands like

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Forget uh- thousands of passengers, I'm talking a boat that can hold twelve people max.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
max. And so I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And so I catch the ferry boat across and I start hiking. And at the end of the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
first day. I come to a beach and I met a guy on the beach who introduces himself as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
as ?Gert Van Kolen?, a Dutchman. And ?Gert? tells me what he wants to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
His plan is to climb to the top of the island's tallest peak, Mount Bowen

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Mount Bowen. And I gotta tell you, when you look across from the mainland

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
at Hinchinbrook Island, Mount Bowen dominates. Absolutely dominates.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Absolutely dominates. And so before, as soon as ?Gert? started telling me about his

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and I didn't really have to wait for him to ask me. I knew I was in.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I, I, I'm in. I'm a- all over this.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
this. We break camp at first thing the next morning and we start

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
making our way up the side of Mount Bowen. Now there's something that I should point out

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
out. There's no trail to the top of Mount Bowen. All

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
All right, we're on a wilderness island. So the way that you get to the top is that you follow a creek bed up.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And you- you bushwhack and you boulder hop

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and this is what we did all day. We found a place

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
place to set up camp for the night and strung up a tarpaulin in case it 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
rained. We were kind of. Yeah we were kind of tough hiking boys, we were way beyond tents.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We set the tarpaulin up and cook dinner. ?Gert? had just got into his sleeping bag.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I was just about to climb into mine when I realize, 'hang on a minute

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
minute before I do that...I need to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
use a bathroom.' Which is kind of nuts because there are no bathrooms in the middle of

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
a wilderness island, but basically I needed to take a leak.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
If you've ever spent much time in the back country you'll know that it's not really a good idea

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to go and take a leak into

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
a creek that your water supply. Especially

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
when you're coming back down the same way in a couple of days.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So I figured you know, what the best way for me to move uh, far enough away from this creek is I should

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
uh, make my way to the other side and I should mention the creek at this point is literally just a trickle

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
trickle tunning down the center. And on the other side is a steep rock

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
wall about twelve or fourteen foot high and I thought, 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that's perfect I can scramble up over that, I'll be fine. So I make my way across and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
as luck would have it, at least I thought it was luck,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I found a crack. I got my hands in that crack. I got

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
my left hand up as high as I could. Got my other hand in the crack, put my right foot

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
up against the wall and as I pulled up the world literally gave way.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.000
As I've

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
pulled up a, um a refrigerator-sized piece of rock broke

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
broke loose from the rock wall and absolutely slammed

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
me back down into that creek bed. And I'm talking slammed. I was instantly. In this

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
world of pain. I just-- I screamed out. ?Gert?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
?Gert? came running across to be greeted by the scene of me

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
from the hips down underneath this huge piece of rock and things got pretty frantic

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
at that point. Right? I can't even begin to describe

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
what that pain

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
felt like it. Just this incredible pain just grinding, grinding down into my legs. And there's only

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
one thing going through my mind, I need this thing off me. I need it off me right now.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So I'm pushing at it. Gert jumped in beside me. We are both pushing at this thing with all, all our

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
might. I feel like I'm going to tear

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
myself in half. But nothing's happening. Nothing's happening.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You know when something really serious happens, there's only two ways that things are gonna go. You're either

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You're either going to freak. Or things are gonna get crystal clear. And luckily for me, things

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
became crystal clear. I

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I took charge. I told ?Gert? what he needed to do. We started out, we tried a series of levers to

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to lift the rock. It didn't work. We start, we tried using a wedge-shaped stone

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
wedge-shaped stone driven by another stone as a hammer stone to try and lift it that way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that way. Didn't work. Nothing worked.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Just when I thought

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I felt the first few drops of rain. Now

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Now I'm in a creek bed. Those drops

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Those drops turned into a torrential downpour. And within forty five minutes I had water

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
water swirling around my hips. Within an hour and a half I had a raging

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
flooding creek up around my waist. And

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And things got desperate. ?Gert? had started to build a dam.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I'm starting to think back about my new backpack. With 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
it has the same kind of

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
of frame as a previous backpack I had used before that had an

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
aluminum frame made out of aluminum tubing. Because

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I'm thinking, if it has I can take that and I can stretch it out. And I can use that as a snorkel when the

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
water goes over my head. Because

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I'm convinced the water is going over my head because I can see by the high water mark on the wall

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
beside me that it's gone over my head before.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
As suddenly as it had started 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the rain stopped. Right, and then gradually

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And gradually over the next couple of hours the water level started to subside. But

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
we still had a problem. I was still stuck underneath a one ton piece of

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
rock.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
[pause]

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I spent the longest night of my life before we decided that ?Gert? would hike

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
out in the morning. That's the only way that I'm coming out. Is for him to hike out and organize

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
a rescue.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
As the sun come up the next morning, I watched Gert pack together his things. He packed

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
he packed together some things for me. We put him in a plastic bag and, and slung

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
it uh, over my shoulders around my neck in case the water would come

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
up again while he was gone.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Here's this guy. I can tell you, I have never ever ever felt so lonely as watching this guy, hugging this guy

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
goodbye and watching him turn around and hike back down off that

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
mountain. Because I know I'm going to be there for at least another 24

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
hours on my own. He's gotta make it back down to the beach

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
where we'd met the day before.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
before. He's then gotta hike back along the beach

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to where the ferry boat dropped us off. The ferry boat then only comes in

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
once a day. Right? I knew I was staring down the barrel

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
of my ultimate test. So

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So after.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
after he went I did the only thing that I could do and I settled in to wait.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
To wait. And to think. Alright.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I thought about all the people that I would probably never see again. Actually wrote letters

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
to some of those people. I wrote letters to my mum and dad. I didn't think I'd

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
ever be seeing them again.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I got angry. Actually, I got really angry.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I wondered why I couldn't be happy staying at home

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
watching T.V. and mowing the lawn on a Sunday afternoon like a lot of my friends that I grew up with.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
up with. Why couldn't I be satisfied with that? Why did I always have to be

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
traveling around the world? Chasing, chasing. Looking for something. Searching. And then I

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And then I remembered, "Ah the connection. Chasing

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
the connection. Then I'd think, "Great."

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
"How's this? Is this connected enough for ya?"

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They're going to find you out here in a couple of days dead."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
"dead. Under this rock."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
under this rock." And then I would pull myself out from that- that, from that

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
trough and bring myself and psych myself that y'know, "You've gotta hang in there, you're gonna get through this." And I rode

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
rode that rollercoaster ride all

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
all day and all of the next night. By the next morning I'd started

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to hallucinate. I thought I was hallucinating when I saw a, a

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
a red pool around my right foot. I could actually see my right foot the way I was trapped. And I thought,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
"This is interesting, it's a little late now to start bleeding." And then I saw why.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I saw a nipper of a freshwater crayfish pop

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.000
up out of the water. And I couldn't believe it. I just thought, "You opportunistic bastard! How"

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
"How dare"

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
"you take on a guy that stuck under a refrigerator-sized"

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
piece of rock like that." I couldn't believe the cheek of that guy, and I spent the next couple of hours trying to kill

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
him with a long stick. [laughter] Now

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
you gotta remember, now as this is happening I'm starting to think that I'm in some kind of David Lynch movie. Just when I

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
when I thought that it couldn't get any more

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
bizarre, I felt a sting -- in my groin. And then

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And then another sting. And I started swatting ants.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
ants.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I looked down and realized that I had quite a few ants running all

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
over me. And I noticed to my horror

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
a trail that lead

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
back to a now-exposed nest that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
was behind this refrigerator-sized piece of rock

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
rock that I was now underneath and I realized that these guys were actually

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
looking for a new home. And I freaked. Right, I

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Right, I just freaked.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I, I, I just had visions because by now I'm starting to lose it and I knew that I couldn't let myself

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
go to sleep. I thought that if you go to sleep now you might not wake up. And I just had visions of, of,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
of, of these ants getting into my ears and my eyes and it was like a horror movie. I freaked.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I remembered that in my first aid kit I had a tube of, of bug goop. And I

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And I prayed that ?Gert? had put that first aid kit in the plastic bag, around my

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
my neck and he had. I pulled out that goop and I'm tellin' ya I just rubbed it all over my

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
my face-all over my, my head. All over my clothes. I rubbed it into my eyes. I didn't

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I didn't care how much it stung, I just covered myself in the stuff and hoped

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that it would work. And eventually I

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
dr-drifted off.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I woke up

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I woke up to the sound of a helicopter.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And I don't think I've ever been so happy to see another human being as ?Chief Jeff?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
as the paramedic made his way towards me and started to stabilize me. Two more guys

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
came down and they spent the next two and a half hours lifting

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
this rock off me before they winched me into a helicopter and sped me straight

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to Cairns Base Hospital. [pause] I woke

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I woke up

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the following afternoon into a whole new world.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
world. Right, I woke up minus both legs, amputated.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
at mid-thigh. And so begun my new life.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
life.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
life. I had to learn how to do everything again. I had to learn how to use

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
wheelchair. I had to learn how to use prosthetic legs. But

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
at, at

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
at the same time I was, I was driven by this, by this purpose. The clarity

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
that had come to me under the rock was still with me. And so I pushed,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
pushed, pushed to just reclaim all these different parts of my life. But there was one

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
thing, one burning question away in the back of my mind. And that was

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And that was, "This is

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
great but am I ever going to feel that connection again? Am I ever going to experience

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
a wild place? Experience nature on its own terms?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Is there

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
anyway that that can happen?" I eventually discovered that you can put

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
fat wheels, mountain bike wheels onto a wheelchair.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I said, "Where, where do I get'em?" [laughter]

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I started quote, unquote hiking and it was on one of those

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
first hikes. I'd just hiked five miles and I'd just had my

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
first swim. In a, in a water hole in a river -- my first swim outside of a swimming

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
pool -- and this light bulb got off and I, I

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I thought, "If I can do this already, I wonder if I could climb"

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
"I could climb a mountain. I wonder if a guy with no legs could climb a mountain?"

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And I got this picture of a mountain in Tasmania that I'd climbed twice before called Cradle Mountain.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And it had taken me about five hours car to car. And I thought, "D'you know what? There is only one way

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
to find out."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So I started training. And a couple of months later. [pause] Just

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Just ten months after losing both legs, I set out from the parking

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
lot and over the course of two and a half days I wheeled, I dragged

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I dragged, I scraped, I crawled on my guts at times, until

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I got to sit on top of Cradle Mountain.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[pause] And, I

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I gotta tell ya, sitting on top of that mountain I just got completely, completely

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
overwhelmed with emotion. I felt like I'd got hit by a semi trailer-load

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
of emotions. Everything came flooding back at me--the accident, the

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
the rescue. The months and months of, of, of rehabilitation. Everything that I'd

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Everything that I'd lost. But in that moment, I realized

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I realized, that I might have

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
lost my legs, but I'd gained so, so,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
so much more.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The thing that most overwhelmed me was that feeling of being connected.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And I realized in that moment that I'd actually found my way home. Thank 

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000
you. [applause]

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
[applause]
