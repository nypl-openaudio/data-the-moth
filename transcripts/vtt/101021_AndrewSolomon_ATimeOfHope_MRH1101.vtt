00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
lot of my work is about resilience. I've written about

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it in a whole range of contexts. I wrote about it among artists who were responding to the Soviet Union.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I wrote about it in the context of a fat book about

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
depression. And having been so interested in resilience and so interested in art,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was fascinated to think about a place where there was no art. And under the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Taliban in Afghanistan there was no art at all. And

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so I decided that I would go there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
immediately after the American invasion and see what happened after the Taliban

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
had fallen.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now there are arguments to be made that if you are gay and Jewish

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with an anxiety disorder and a tendency toward

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
depression a field trip to war-ravaged Afghanistan

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
may not be incredibly sound

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
judgment. And there were those who tried to discourage me, but

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I went. And when I got there, I thought, 'this is a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
whole new level of anxiety,' and I thought, 'but at

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
least, at least I've got my story to do.' So, my first port of call

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
was the U.N. because that was sort of the center of everything that was happening, and I went... and I met with someone at the U.N. and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
said, "I've come, I'm doing a story. The New York Times agreed to send me, and I'm going to write about

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the resurgence of art in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban." I said, "And you've been

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
living here for some time." I said, "Do you know any artists?" And he

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
said, "There are no artists in Afghanistan." And

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I said, "Oh." I said, "Well...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
maybe some poets? Or some musicians? And he said, "There are no poets

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in Afghanistan," he said, "but there's someone downstairs

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
whose sole job, actually, has been to look at the music of Afghanistan and in fact, try to get it out into the world and he'd probably know

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
know all about the musicians, so, if you just go downstairs, you could talk to him, and I imagine

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
he'll be able to help you." And I thought, that would be great because while I could just

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
about imagine a world without film and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
without photography and without acting and without poetry and without

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
any kind of figurative visual art, I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
couldn't really imagine a country without music - a country where it had

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
been illegal for a mother to hum to her child. People had been

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
arrested for that. A country where it's illegal even to clap. And so

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I went downstairs

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to the man who'd come to study music in Afghanistan, and I did my little patter song, and I said I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was there to write about all of these things, and I said, "Now, I wonder, you've been studying this," I said, "Can

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
you tell me about some musicians in Afghanistan?" And he said,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
"There is no music in Afghanistan." And I thought, 'I've

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
come quite a long

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
way to get the story of how there is actually no art or music

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in Afghanistan. And fortunately I had a translator with me,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
my translator Farooq, who was and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
is an amazing friend, and who had trained as a doctor under the Taliban.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Which meant that each day he had eight hours of instruction:

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
seven hours of religious instruction, and one hour of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
medical instruction. And he felt that he didn't really know enough to be a doctor,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and had decided to be a translator for a while while he tried to educate himself. And

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Farooq said to me, "You

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
know, I don't know much about the things you're interested in," he said, "but, there

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is actually a museum in Kabul. It's small, but it's the National Gallery

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Afghanistan, and they're sort of re-opening it later today,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and we could probably get into that, if you wanted to go." And I said, "I would

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
definitely like to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
go." And we went off to the museum, and we went

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
in, and on the walls of the museum there were a lot of empty

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
landscapes. And, of course, the Taliban had said that the representation of the human

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
figure or even of animals was contrary to Islamic law, a debatable point, but one that they had

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
held. And it turned out that there was an artist, Dr. ??Asifi??,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
who had, when the Taliban came to power, gone into the museum at night with

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
a set of watercolors, and he had painted over all of the figures

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
within the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
paintings. And when we got there, Dr. Asifi

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
was there. And he had a bucket of water, and he had a piece of cloth, and Karzai,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
who seemed like the great hope at that point, had come for this opening as well, and the electricity kept going out

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the way it did everywhere in Kabul that winter. And Dr. Asifi carried his

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
bucket, and he dipped his piece of cloth in, and he began to rub the surface

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of one of the paintings, and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
suddenly, everything began to appear. The figures came out. The

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
animals came out. What the painting was about came out, and everyone

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
burst into

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
applause. And Dr. Asifi said to me that he had a friend

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
who was the greatest painter of miniatures. The Persian miniature is an art that began

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in Herat, and the Afghans, therefore, claim it as their own. And he said, "Go and see this

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
guy who does the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
miniatures." And there was no phone system in Afghanistan at that point, and there was no postal

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
system, and there were certainly no fax or e-mail, and the only way to see anyone was to

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
go and show up where they were. So I got the address of this other artist and I went off to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
see

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
him. And he showed me these exquisite miniatures that he was painting. And I said, "They're

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
very, very beautiful." I said, "But they seem, they seem very,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
very traditional." And I said, "Are you introducing any kind of innovation?" And

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
he said

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to me, "Ah," he said, "You come from the West, where the past is safe,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and so you can make things that are about the future, but for those of us

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
in Afghanistan, whose past has been very nearly annihilated, we have to

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
secure the past before we can even begin to think about the future."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And he said to me, "If you want to understand these feelings," he said, "I do know a poet who has gone

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
back to writing secular poetry. You should go and see him." And, so, the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
next day we went to see the poet, and we showed up at his house. And he showed me some of his poems

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
one of which said,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
"On the highest escarpment, on the sharpest peak

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
inscribe this epitaph of the futureless generation: That instead of mother's milk

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
we were given guns. And instead of education

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we were given war.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Don't blame us. We could do nothing for you."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And he said to me, "You should talk to other people who are writing and other people who are doing things."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And he gave me a few more names and addresses. And one of them, it was for a woman who

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
was doing poetry with some other women. And we went to their

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
house, and they agreed to come and meet with us, someplace else. And when they walked

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
in they were all wearing burkas,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And they took off the burkas, so that we could sit and talk, and they were incredibly sophisticated and cosmopolitan.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I said, "The Taliban has fallen. Why are you still wearing that thing? Why

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is everyone in Kabul still wearing those burkas?" And one of them said, "Well.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I'm wearing it because they might come back to power, and if they do,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
they'll punish anyone who went out without one." And one of them said, "I'm wearing

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
this because if I get raped or beaten up, people

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
will say it was my own

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
fault." And then the third one, who was the poet, said,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
"I always thought if the Taliban fell, I would burn this thing, and I would never put it on again.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But you know,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
after five years, you get used to being invisible, and the prospect of

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
being visible again is very

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
overwhelming." She was the one who said to me, "There's a lot of music.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There's a lot

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
of music." And she said, "This is the best singer. You should go and see this man." And she gave

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
me his name and his address. And so the next day, we went to his house. And we arrived.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And he greeted us, and he was very warm, and we stood outside the house for a minute, and I said to him,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
"You are a singer." I said, 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
"You couldn't sing for all of these years. You had no music at all." I said, "Didn't you go crazy?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Wouldn't one to go crazy, having no music at all?" And he said, "At the

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
beginning, I thought I would go crazy." He said, "But then I realized that there was

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
a kind of music that even the Taliban couldn't forbid." He said, "Come in." And we

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
walked into his house, and as we were walking in, he said, "A few months after they came to power

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I went to the market and I bought twenty pigeons,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and I bought twenty doves, and they've lived in the house with me ever since." And we sat in

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
his room while these doves and pigeons

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
flew around us and circles. The room was a

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
mess. Um. And he said that was the music, and he

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
said, "If you're really interested in music." He said, "There's actually a

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
group of amazing musicians, who are really trying to bring back the great

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Afghan classical tradition." He said "They practice most

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
afternoons in the basement of a building opposite the television tower. Go

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
there and hear what they're

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
doing." So that afternoon, Farooq and I went off to hear the other musicians.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And when we arrived, they were in this basement. It was cold in Kabul. It was

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
February. There was no heating anywhere. They were sitting there and they were playing with gloves on on

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
string instruments,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
which, I must say, does not improve the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
performance. Um. But nonetheless they were playing beautifully, and I sat, and I

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
watched them. And at the end of an hour,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
they said, "You seem so interested." They said, "Do you have any questions for us?" And I said,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
"If you weren't able to play for all those years, how did you remember these instruments and what to

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
do with them?"

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And one of them said to me, "You know, we couldn't practice

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
in real life during the day, but I practiced every night in my dreams."

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And then I said to one of them, "The instrument your playing - I know that's a traditional Afghan instrument. All

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the instruments were supposed to be destroyed when the Taliban came to power. How did you keep it? And in good

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
shape

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
too?" And he said, "Oh yes, this is a Sarinda."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He said, "And what I did was, I had a wood pile behind the house, where I

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
kept all of the wood, and I put the Sarinda in the middle of the wood pile. And every few

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
days I'd bring in some more logs, or I'd take some logs away, and I'd rearrange it, and if you were only

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
looking at it from the end,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
it could pass for scrap wood. And I knew that if any of my neighbors reported me,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I could get stoned to death." He said, "but it gave me such comfort to know it was there, in

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
the

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
pile." And then I said, "I've loved hearing your music." And they said, "But, you know, there are

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
only seven of us here today, and there are actually eleven in our group. We could get

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the whole group together, if you want to hear us all play." And I said, "I would love that." And they

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
said, "Well, when do you want to do it?" And I said, "How about

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Friday?" And they said, "Sure, Friday would be good." And I said,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
"Afternoon? Five o'clock?" And they said, "Five o'clock would be great." And then I had a little inspiration, and

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I said, "I'm happy to come back and hear you playing here again. I know this is where you

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
practice, but actually a group of journalists and I rented an old al-Qaeda house."

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Which were the only houses that actually did have heating in Kabul at that point they

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
said, and, "Maybe you'd like to come and play someplace where you didn't have to have gloves on your

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
hands to play string

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
instruments." And they said, "That would be fantastic." And I said great, "So five o'clock

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Friday. This is where I'm living. I'll see you then."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And then we left, and I thought, 'Wow. I have eleven musicians coming to play

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in the house at five o'clock on Friday. And,' I thought,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
'those poets we saw, and that other singer, we should invite them to come and hear these guys,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
these guys are really

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
amazing.' And I thought, 'we should find the, the artists we saw.' And then

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I thought 'And I'd love to invite Marla.' My friend Marla, the human rights activist who was

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
living down the block, and who was killed in Iraq, and who I miss. And I wanted to invite the

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
other journalists with whom I was sharing the house.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And I had to invite the man from the U.N. who had told me that there was no music in

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Afghanistan. And I thought 'I'll just invite all the people I've met.' I had been there only a week,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
but I had met a lot of people. And Farooq and I spent Thursday going around and inviting

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
people, and we invited everyone.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And there was a guy who cooked at the house where we were staying and I said to him, "There's going to be a bunch of people coming

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
on Friday. Could you by any chance provide some snacks for people?" And he said,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
"I, I could make dinner, if you want me to."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And I said, "I, I don't think you could make dinner." I said, "There'll be eighty or ninety people coming here."

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And he said, "Ohh," he said, "eighty or ninety." He said, "Well, the only way I

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
could make dinner for eighty or ninety people would be if I got an assistant, and I had money to buy

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
ingredients

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and, you know, that's a big thing." And I said, "Well, I understand that." I said, "What would be involved in it?"

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
He said, "You know that would cost,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I mean, it could be a hundred fifty, it could be even two hundred dollars to do dinner for

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
90." And I said, "I'm going to spring for it."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And I said, "You go ahead and do that." And so the next day, it was Friday,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and at five o'clock the musicians arrived. And they sat down, and they began to play.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And it was so long since they'd had an audience and they'd had people who wanted to

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
listen. And the Afghans came, and the foreigners who I'd got to know came, and the

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
guy from the U.N. came, and everyone came. And there was this amazing buffet dinner.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I went to Afghanistan to do a piece for The New York Times, but after I returned,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I did a piece for 'Food & Wine'

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
magazine. Um.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
But we sat there, and everyone ate. And the musicians were so enraptured by having us all

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
there, that they would get up one at a time to get some food or to do something, but they just

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
never stop playing, and they went on, and they played ,and they played. And the Afghans started showing the

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
rest of us how to do certain kinds of traditional dancing to the music. And we began

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
dancing. And they played. And we ate. And someone showed up with

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
a bottle of whiskey, which was strictly contraband in Afghanistan at that point. It was sort of like

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
being in tenth grade and having to someone show up at your party with a bag of

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
weed. And I taught Farooq in English, so he could teach, as

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
well as he could, in some relevant language everyone else. The word for "Hangover" which

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
was a word they had not previously

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
needed.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And they just went on playing. And the music seemed to get more beautiful the more

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
they played, and the more they played together. And it was warm. And it was glowing.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And there was a curfew in Kabul at ten o'clock, and you couldn't be in the streets past ten o'clock,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and so, at nine thirty I began saying

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
to people, "Do you, do you want to get home? It's gonna be 10 o'clock soon." I said it to the

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
musicians, and the musicians said, "Oh, it would take us an hour and a half to get home. We've missed the curfew.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We'll have to stay." And the guests started saying, "Oh, I can't leave

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
while this is happening." And the musicians went on playing. And the curfew,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
was a curfew until dawn. And they played until six o'clock the following morning

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
without ever taking a break.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Thirteen solid hours of

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
music. And afterwards, I thought to myself that when I'd written

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
about depression I had said, there's a kind of joy which is possible only after

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
you've been profoundly

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
depressed. And I realized, there is a kind of music that is possible only after you've

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
been silent for 5

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
years. And that I had been the fortunate witness to those extraordinary sounds

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and to that sacred and holy moment when the music began again.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I told Farooq a few days ago on SKYPE that I was going to tell this story, and

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
we had a long talk about it and went over some of the

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
details. And when we finished, Farooq, for whom I've tried to get a visa to come here,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
now for almost ten years, Farooq said to me,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
"I'm so glad that you will tell that story, and that people will be able to

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
remember the moment of hope, when the American invasion had just happened, and we were

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000
so joyful and had such belief in what we thought was going to come." Thank

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
you.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
[Applause]
