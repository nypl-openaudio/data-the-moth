00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When I first moved to Minneapolis, everything in my life went horribly wrong.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I transferred to a small art school.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And my girlfriend wrecked my car. Said girlfriend became an ex-girlfriend.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And the house I was living in was condemned. I was working for minimum wage in a comic

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
book store during the day. And going to my night classes at art school. It was not a high

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
point in my life.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But the only thing that kept me going was the thought of spring break.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Just one week, back home with my parents and friends, and away from this life. And

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've been saving. I'd been saving for six months but this trip. Because when you make minimum wage, saving

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for anything takes a really long time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so I finished my last final at school and I went home and celebrated my new bachelorhood by

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
ordering a Domino's Pizza.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Eating it off napkins and playing video games all night. And two days

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
later I was

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
packed and I was ready to go home. All I had to do was drop my last paycheck off at the bank.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And I went into the bank and I handed the teller my check. And I got the receipt and I flipped it over and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on the back my account balance was negative five hundred thirty six

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
dollars. And I felt all the life

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
just drain out of me because I just, I couldn't catch a break.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And so I asked to see my balance statement,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and there they were, two six hundred dollar Western Union money transfers,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a bunch of random delivery orders, and a four hundred dollar charge to a website called

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
InmateCanteen.com

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
com [crowd laughs]

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And so, so I sat down with the banker and she saw that the charges were false and went about trying to reverse them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And while she was doing that I went and I sat in the lobby and I started thinking about

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
how unfair identity theft is.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
identity theft is. Because when somebody steals your identity they only take

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the good parts,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you know? They

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
[crowd laughs and applaudes] don't

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
take the rattrap apartment and the depression and the shitty

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
job. No, they just take the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
one thing that I had been looking forward to for the past six months. And while

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And while I'm mulling this over. The banker comes back and she tells me that the bank is going to give me all my

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
money back. But it's going to take about a week of processing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
processing. And so I go home, and I

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
can't get it out of my head. Because the bank wasn't going to do anything about this,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and the police weren't going to do anything about this, and these people that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
rob you...they don't get caught. Nobody

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
cares enough. But this identity theft was different

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because this person had messed with the most dangerous type of person that exists, which is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
someone with limited options and a lot of free time.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And so I decided to start my own investigation. And so I took my bank records and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I started going through them and I called Western Union

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Union. And they were no help. And I went to inmatecanteen.com

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
com

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and I called the support number but it was disconnected.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And so all I had were these delivery charges and I noticed something,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which is that they were, they were local. And then it hit me.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The last charge that I had made on my own account was the last night of my finals. The night that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I ordered that Domino's Pizza and I realized that when I read my credit card number over the phone the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
woman at Dominoes must have written it down and used it again. The woman at

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Domino's robbed

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
me! And this was this was more upsetting,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
because this was someone that could live six blocks from me, who spoke to me on the phone and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
heard my voice. Someone who I trusted. I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
mean. I trusted

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Domino's. Out of all the people and things in my life that could betray

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
me Domino's was not on the list!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And lastly

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
because I spent years as a delivery driver and this broke

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the code of ethics.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So this wasn't just a theft, this felt personal. And so I had a suspect,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and the next day I marched into that Domino's and I demanded to know who was working the night my identity was stolen.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And the manager on duty passed me to his manager who passed me to his manager. And eventually they told me to come

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
back later and they would have the names for me.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So I continued my investigation and I went to a place called the Green Mill which was a restaurant where some of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
some of the false delivery charges had taken

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
place. And the manager there was really helpful because there was nothing else to do,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and he gave me a week's worth of delivery tickets, and I started digging through them looking for a match.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And after about thirty minutes the phone rang and he picked it up and start taking down an order. And he picks up a

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
piece of paper inserts waving it back and forth and I come over and on the paper is a credit card number,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and it's my credit card number, and the person who stole my credit card is on the other end of that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
phone and the manager is looking at me like "well what do we do now?!"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I look him straight in the eyes and I say "give me a topper, a hat and I will take that

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
delivery!"

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[cheering and applause]

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And he looks at me and he says 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
"and that will get me fired". And I say OK maybe that wasn't the best idea.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Tell them

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
them that your driver is out sick and that it's pick up only.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And so he does and he hangs up and he looks at me and he says "they'll be here in 15 minutes".

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 And so I grab a newspaper

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and I sit down in a booth and I

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
prop it up.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And I sit down for my very first stakeout. And

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
an agonizing seventeen minutes

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
later. A car pulls in, a woman gets out and comes inside and asked for her pick

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
up order. And I start writing down every detail.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The fact that it's a white lifted Chevy Tahoe. The license plate number. What she's wearing and what

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
she looks like. And meanwhile she's having a conversation with the manager and he's saying that the card was

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
declined and he needs to run it again. But she says she doesn't have it on her and it's in her car

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and she

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
leaves the restaurant and doesn't come back. And so I asked the manager to do me one more favor, 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I asked him to *69 the number

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
69 the number she called from, and I had that cellphone number to my growing list of evidence.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
A couple hours later I receive a call from a man who introduces himself as the head of Domino's

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And he was calling to

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
apologize, to thank me for my help in the investigation and to know that once I filed a

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
police report that Domino's had my back. He'd also

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
pulled the hours I wanted and had them waiting at the original Domino's

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
shop. So I went back and I picked them up and I started asking questions there.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And I asked if anyone there drove a white lifted Chevy Tahoe. And

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the daytime driver said that a girl who worked the night shift did. A girl who matched the description

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of the person who came into the Green Mill. Who was also working the night that my identity was stolen.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Lastly I took the cell phone number and gave it to the manager. Because I didn't want to call myself and arouse suspicion,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
so he called it and she answered and confirmed her identity, 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
damning herself. So next 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I asked to see her application, because those places always keep those things on file. And at

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
first the manager was wary of the legal things with

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that, but once I assured him that this was for the police

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
report...he

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
relented. And so after I've copied down this information now

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I have her first, middle and last name, her date of birth, her social security number,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
her driver's license number. I know her car make and model and the license plate number. I know where

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and when she works and where

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
she lives and her previous job references. And her email address.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And so I go home and I just...I'm in a frenzy and I can't stop.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And so I google her e-mail address and when you do that you can pull up all of the

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
accounts that you've created with that e-mail

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
address. And so I found her E-bay account, and her Flickr account, and her My Space.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And her My Space was set to public and I can see her pictures and her comments and her blogs and I

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
realize that I am going

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
crazy. [crowd laughs]

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But the thing about going crazy is you

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
can't stop. And so I open one of

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
her blogs called fifty things about me.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And the very first question is what is my favorite food. And she wrote...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
pizza. And so by the time I'm at the end of this list

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I realize that I know more about this

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
woman probably than most of her coworkers and friends. And that

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
this is a real person that I will

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
be sending to jail. But she broke the

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
code. And so I call the cops.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And the next day they send out a police officer to take my report. And the fraud report starts out normal,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
it's just how much money was stolen and when was it stolen is a bank reimbursing you. And then the

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
last question almost as an afterthought was "do you have any additional information which might benefit

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the case?"

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And I said "why, yes I do." And I start listing things.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
things. And the confusion on the officers face turns to laughter when she hears the full story

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and she says that "well, you've done my job for me."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
me". And I agree.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Later on that day I receive a call from the detective now working this case. He says that with all my

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
information he cross checked it with the DOT records in the criminal database and that all checks out,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and that by the end of the day there would be a warrant out for this woman's arrest.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I tell him that she's going to work tomorrow at Domino's at five.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
[laughter and clapping]

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And after a pause he says that he'll have a squad car waiting for

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
her.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And so lastly I asked the detective

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
if I can be there.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Because I've done a lot of work on this! And

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I kind of wanted to

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
see the look on her face. That same look of shock and horror that I had when I

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
was sitting in that bank and I flipped that receipt over and saw

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
everything I had saved gone. But he said that was impossible.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.000
He did

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
say that if I happen to be walking across the street at around five o'clock

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that no one would probably be the wiser.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So I gotta go undercover one last time. And I found myself standing

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
across the street from that Domino's at five o'clock squad car parked in back in two officers inside.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I saw that white lifted Chevy Tahoe come around the corner, and park, and her get out and go

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
through the front door and I could see her back arched up...she froze and saw the

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
officers because she knew she was caught.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And then they handcuffed her, put her in the back of the squad car and they drove away. Case closed.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But then a couple hours later I received one of the most surreal phone calls I've ever gotten my entire life.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The man on the other end of the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
line introduced himself as the C.E.O. of Domino's. He was calling to

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
personally apologize, thanked me for my help in the investigation, and I assume

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
avoid a

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
giant lawsuit. And so he asked me how much money was

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
stolen and told me that Domino's would reimburse me for everything, and I told him that the bank was already doing

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that and that it wasn't about the money. And so he asked me what I wanted.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And up until this point I hadn't really thought about it, but what do you say I mean, free pizza for

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
life? A pizza named after me?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I'd lost my taste for pizza at this point.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
No, I told him I didn't want this to happen to anyone else. I told him that I wanted him

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to pursue this to the furthest extent of

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the law and that every new Domino's employee that gets hired would hear this story... that if

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
if you f*** with credit card information of customers that you will go to

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
jail. And he said he could do that. [laughter]

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
later I received two letters in the mail.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
The first was a letter that said the woman had pleaded guilty to all charges and will

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
be serving a short prison sentence. The second a personal

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
thank you letter from the C.E.O. of

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Domino's, a check for the exact amount of money stolen, and five hundred Domino's

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
bucks. [laughter]

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And I realize that I actually did get everything back that was stolen.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The money,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
yes, but for that week I wasn't the pathetic

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
depressed art student. No! for that

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
week I was Tristen Jimerson...Private

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Eye. [laughter]

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
The gum-shoe that

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
knows that revenge, like delivery pizza, is best served cold.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Thank you.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
[applause and cheering]
