00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(Audience Applause)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I grew up in Afghanistan. During the Russian occupation and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
As a child I remember my dad being gone a lot. The subject of my dad's whereabouts

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 was somewhat taboo in my household because my mom told us

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
told us we were to never ask about him, so we never did. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Sometimes I wondered if he cared about me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Growing up during a war was very difficult because we had bomb explosions

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and missile attacks on a daily basis in the background of our

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
lives. And by the time I was ten, 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
these explosions were getting closer and closer to the city of Kabul where we used to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
live. In fact, sometimes the explosions would be so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
close that there's a distinct whistling sound that the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
missile makes right before hitting its target. And you could hear that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And in the meantime there was a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
rumor about a regime change,  which was devastating news for my

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
dad,  who was a high ranking officer working for the current

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
regime.  And  historically the new regime

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
takes over by violently dismantling the old regime.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
My parents were desperate to try to get out of the country. But they couldn't

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
because the government put a lockdown on everybody's visas.  They needed everyone to stay and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
fight the war for them. The only way to get out of the country was on forged papers.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 In the early 1990's, after a daring escape

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in the middle of the night,  my parents and my brother and I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
migrated to the US on forged papers

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and asked for political asylum.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This meant that we could stay here temporarily while

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 they reviewed our case. They gave us a work permit and driver's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 license, social security cards, those type of things. So we 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
started, all of us,  started working and our family in California helped us

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
get settled. In five years, fast

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
forwarding, 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
our lives were so normal

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that,  the worst thing in my mind at that time

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
was how I could get my mom to let me stay out late -like expanding my curfew. And I'm

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
at my first job at the Men's Warehouse and my dad calls me. And I

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I could hear by the certain excitement in his voice that there was something going on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and he tells me you need to come home right away because there's 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
there's a letter from the immigration, and I speak the best

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 English in my household so he wanted me to come home and translate.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And for those of you who've been lucky enough not to be familiar with the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
immigration system, they don't send you regular updates like, "Hey, still 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
thinking about you all, haven't forgotten about you."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So we were kind of puzzled by this letter and ultimately 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
decided it was a good letter because they inquired. You know

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
they sent a letter without us inquiring about it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I rushed home and I find my dad in his security uniform

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which he often wore and My mom comes home too

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 and my brother comes home because my dad called all of them and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm sitting on the dining table and all three of them are kind of hovered

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 over me and they're like kind of rushing me," Come on, come on, read it!  What does it say? What does say?"

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And so I just read just the highlights really quickly and it says our appointment has been 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 moved up to next week.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And it says that we need to bring all of our legal documents. And our family photos

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and things that are important. We start jumping up and down and we're thinking

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 "This is it. This is the appointment that we've been waiting for!"

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And the day of our appointment we drive forty five minutes to downtown LosAngeles and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
we go into a big government building. You walk in

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and there's metal detectors, we go past that, and check in with security guards.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We go up stairs and there's an immigration officer waiting for us. And he guides us into this room.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And the moment that the doors open up. It was

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 like all of us looked at each other, we felt like we were in the wrong place.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The people that were sitting there

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 ,they looked like they were visibly upset. Some of them were still crying. But we

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
still went ahead and we sat down

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and they told us that, "Just sit down until you hear your last name".

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And after a while, My dad asked me to go and ask 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 the security guard how long this appointment was going to take and what were we here for,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Because he was dressed in his uniform he needed to get back to work. So I go

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 up and I ask this immigration  officer, "Hey, can you tell me how long this appointment might take because my dad

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 needs to get back to work and he

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
says, " Your dad will go back to work all right, just not in 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
this country". And  it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
was like my heart just dropped. Going back

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
is not an option because we were now considered traitors.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I sit down and 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 hesitantly I told my dad this. It was like the moment that I 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
told him what the security guard said about this immigration officer said it's like my

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 dad just lost all the color in his face he just looked pale.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 After a while, I'm looking over at my dad, he's hunched

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 over and he's holding his chest.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And he's visibly in some kind of pain and this

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
pain continues on, so I get up and I go up to the same officer and I ask him if I can

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
use the phone. He says no and then

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 I ask him if I could use the bathroom. And he lets me. I just

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
open up these doors and I

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 start rushing. There's a long hallway. And I'm looking to the left I'm looking to the right

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 I'm just looking for a telephone. And finally I spotted at the end of the hall and I

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
grabbed the phone and I dial our attorney's number.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Now, I was extremely upset with our attorney 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 because we couldn't afford even our own meals, yet the only thing 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that we wanted to be sure that we could have was an attorney and so for her not to be

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
here was really

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 upsetting to me. And this girl answers the phone.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
She sounds like she's about eighteen years old, like my age at that time. And I have to convince her to 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 put our attorney on the phone and she keeps refusing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And finally I tell her it's an emergency, "Please put Jodi on the phone". And as soon as I hear her

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
voice on the other end of the phone I just completely break down. And I

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
explain to her, "Something is wrong with my dad and they won't let us get help for

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 him. She tells me

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
to just sit still,  sit tight and that she was going to see what she could do.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And so we're sitting there

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and my dad continues to be in pain. After thirty to forty-five minutes

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 later, a man walks in and says our last name and all four of us get up

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 and we're following him, we're not sure where but 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 we're following him.  And we end up going to this

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
small office which - it was so small that only my Dad and I could barely fit in there. And there's a

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 man in there who's working on his desk. He 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
didn't even acknowledge that we were standing there he didn't speak to us one word.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
He just hands us,  hands over this paper, and the

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
paper said that our visa had been extended for three months

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 so that we could go get my dad some medical help,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
which we did right right away. And afterwards, the next three months is the

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
worst time of my life by far, because

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 we're afraid of..we're fearing deportation every single day.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And whenever we would see their mailman show up and put mail in our mailbox

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it was like a dreaded task. We, none of us,wanted to go and check our mailbox.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And my dad's behavior was so completely over the top. He moves out of my mom's bedroom and

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 moves into the living room. And our blinds are closed whether it's day or

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
nighttime.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And he sleeps with a pair of clothes right next to him.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And whenever he would hear footsteps he would jump out of the couch and look through the blinds and see who it was.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
was.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We finally go to our final appointment at the end of

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 the three months. And we walk in with our attorney and I notice that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
it was a different judge who was sitting there, it was an older

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
gentleman and he looks really intense and

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 I remember the first time that I saw him, and my mind, I was so

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 intimidated by him because he wouldn't smile, he wouldn't talk, or anything like

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that, and I was pretty intimidated because I had to translate whatever conversation

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 was going to happen because I was our family's translator.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So the judge carries on with our attorney for a little bit and then turns his attention

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 to my dad. And after some basic questions, he gets right into it

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and starts, um, 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 asking my dad if he has a translator and my dad says this... My daughter will translate

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 for us. And he tells me what... he says, " Young lady, whatever

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I say to you, you say, you translate exactly what I say, nothing more nothing less. And

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
whatever your dad says, you tell me exactly what he says nothing more nothing less." And I agree.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I agree.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
He asks my dad questions, really 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
demeaning questions like, " Do I understand correctly?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
That you came here on forged papers?" And my dad starts to say, "Well, yes,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
but..." and he goes on this long explanation. And then he cuts

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 my dad off and says, "I just want to hear yes

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 or no, I don't care about the explanation, I don't need explanation." And so they

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
kind of, this conversation goes on like this. back and forth and it's not going well at all.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and finally

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
he tells my dad,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
"You know, we here in the United States do not

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 give citizenship to people that break the law. We can't and I

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
won't." And as soon as I translate this to my dad 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 I just put my head down and I just start

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
praying.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And when I open up my eyes I see my dad rising out of his

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 seat. And he starts unbuckling his belt at which

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 point I'm thinking he's completely losing his mind. 'Cause I'm not sure what he's

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
getting ready to do. But he lifts up his shirt 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 on the right side. And in his native language, looks at the judge

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 and says,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
"This is what the Communists did to me." He's pointing at

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 a four- to five-inch knife scar.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And then he lift..he pushes down his pants in the back and

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 turns around a little bit

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and again says. "This what the communists did to me" pointing at

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 three gunshot wounds. And then 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 he takes off his shoes and takes off his socks and points at his

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 toes and says, "This is what the communists did to me." He's pointing

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
at his toenails which they had try to pull with pliers.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 And I remember thinking, "I know

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 I am hearing what I'm hearing," but somehow 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
everything wasn't registering,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
because as I am translating these

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
horrible things, I am also learning for the first time [becoming emotional]

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 about my dad's whereabouts.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
In

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
all of those times that I didn't know where he was, he was in prison

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 being tortured. And in that moment

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I have never felt more sorrow.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
He continues

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 to tell the judge, "It's easy for you to judge me. You 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
sit in that seat and you wear this robe, but if you came on this side and you

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 looked at me, one man to another, you will see

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that everything I did,  I did to save my children. I had no

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
other choice

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and you might deny it right now, but had it been you, I know

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
you would do the same thing. And if you have to show the

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
American public that you didn't take it easy on us, I

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
understand. Send me back. I volunteer.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But please let my children stay. Please give my children a new home.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And then he just puts his head down and starts

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
just crying

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
like a baby. And the judges Leaves. We're on a break. And he

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 comes back after an hour. And as soon as he enters the room I notice that he doesn't

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 have his robe on, and we thought, "we're still on break". But he goes

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 up to his chamber and

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
grabs something and starts walking back down

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 and towards us. And we're pretty nervous because we're not sure why he's walking towards

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 us and the entire time his both eyes were on my dad.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
He goes past me, behind me, and stops right next

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 to my dad. My dad turns his chair and looks at him up, and

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 he says,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
"Mr. Samadzai, let me see your hand".

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
My dad shows him his hand and he puts a stamp on my dad's hand and

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
says, "Mr. Samadzai, I would like you to be the 

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 one to stamp your children's papers."

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Together they stamp our papers and when they move their hands

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 It reads, "Asylum granted".

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 He then flips the page to my parents' papers and

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
stamps it with the same stamp, then looks on to my dad

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 and still puts his hand on his shoulder and says,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
"Welcome to America." It took

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
us eighteen years from the

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
day that we arrived here for me to be

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
granted an American citizenship. On January

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
29th, two thousand and nine, As I stood there

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 and I was sworn in as an American citizen, I pledged

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 allegiance to my new homeland.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And it is through my children, my two year old 

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
son and in my unborn child in my womb, that I

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
will make sure that

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
this gratitude that overflows in my heart every

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
single day, will continue to live on long after I am gone. Thank 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
you.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:55.000
[applause}
