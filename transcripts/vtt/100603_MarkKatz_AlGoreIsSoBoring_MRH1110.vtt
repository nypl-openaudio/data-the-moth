00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was packing furiously to catch an early morning Metro-liner to Washington D.C..

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
watching with one eye the political pundit panel on The Today Show when I heard it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Al Gore is so boring his Secret Service code name is Al Gore.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I jump for a pen and paper to write down every syllable of this killer line beforeI forgot it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Because I was on my way to Washington D.C., to the White House to write a funny speech.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
for Vice President Al Gore.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This was March of 1993 and I was now on my fifth consecutive year of career crisis.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
My career took a wrong turn right out of the gate.  Right out of college I joined the Dukakis

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
campaign. [laughter]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But in some ways it was the best job I ever had because I was 22 years old and I knew what I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
wanted more than anything else in the world. I wanted to write jokes for a Democratic president of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the United States. [laughter]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's a weird dream, but it was mine, and America's a great

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
country. [laughter] And, uh, uh, so, and before

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the campaign was over I actually attained, I became the go-to guy in the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
campaign to write the jokes if I knew ?if?. And that's how it became, I earned my moniker, 'The guy who

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
made Mike Dukakis so funny'. [laughter]

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In fact to this day when the Dukakis campaign [is] dismissed as a joke

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I [laughter],

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I get all tingly. [laughter] But I never did get to write jokes for

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
President Mike Dukakis and after the campaign I went on to another line of work that didn't require anyone to get

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
two hundred seventy electoral votes. I went into advertising. And it turned out I had a real

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
talent for advertising. More specifically, I had a talent for getting jobs in agencies just

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about to lose their biggest account.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So in four years I went through four jobs, I was in between

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
jobs in 1992 when something really weird happened. A Democrat got elected.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
president of the United States.  You may remember Bill Clinton.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I called my friends from Dukakis campaign, now honchos in the White House, and I started pitching myself as the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
guy who should be writing President Clinton's jokes for his annual series of humorous speeches to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the White House Correspondents' Dinner and the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
like, and they thought that was pretty audacious for an unemployed copywriter who

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
only had Mike Dukakis, uh, to his credit. So we struck up a bargain.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
He said, "Listen. Al Gore has a speech coming up to the Gridiron Club. Why don't you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
work with him and if that works out. We'll talk about moving up the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
constitutional organisational

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
chart." [laughter] So as I'm sitting on this Metroliner

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to Washington D.C. the stakes could not have been higher. And I am staring at

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
this joke,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Like it's a code that needs to be cracked. Like in these 16 syllables is this.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
E = MC

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Square. Of a, of a joke. That I needed to understand on a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
sub atomic level. So I could unleash its power on behalf -and make a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
speech as funny as that one joke. So for those next three hours that train was like a mobile

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
humor lab where I'm studying this joke. And it was around

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Wilmington, Delaware where I had a breakthrough, I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
realized jokes with the word Al Gore in them were funnier. [laughter]

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There's just something intrinsically funny about the name Al Gore.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And then I hypothesized that if Al Gore said the name Al Gore it would

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
be exponentially

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
funnier. [laughter] And from there I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
extrapolated that if Al Gore said the joke "Al Gore is so boring a Secret Service

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
"Al Gore is so boring, his Secret Service code name is Al Gore,"

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Al Gore would be saying the name Al Gore not once but twice

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and my head began to spin at the very possibilities of it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So by the time this train pulled into Union Station I had an idea for this speech and I'm very excited.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I get out of the train, I jump into a cab and I say the most aggrandizing things you can ever

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
hear yourself say to a cab driver, "To the White House!" [laughter]

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I dropped off at the West Wing gate and I walk in and I announce myself and I'm

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
escorted to the vice president's office and there I meet Lorraine another Dukai'ed done good.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And she, we sit down, talk about the speech and I tell about this idea I have for a speech,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that Al Gore should tell his favorite Al Gore jokes. And she says,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
"Like what?"

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Like, "Al Gore is so boring, his Secret Service code name is Al Gore!"

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Gore!"

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Lorraine falls off her chair with laughter. I couldn't imagine she hadn't heard the joke.  It was on The

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Today Show. So many people come running into the office, 7 or 8 people. She repeats the joke,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
more l-loud raucous laughter.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And in just as fast as that,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I was the owner of that joke. I wrote that joke.  And I couldn't, didn't have the moment, there wasn't a moment to say

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
uh, I, I didn't write that joke I just told you the joke and everyone dispersed and just as quick as that I

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
was the genius who wrote that joke.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Now I'm off, sent off to an office to write the speech

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that has to go along with this joke. And in there for the next 72 hours I'm holed up in a room.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Thinking about the speech it would, would be kind of the proper setting for this crown jewel of a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
joke and it's a whole speech, it's not just one joke. It's many premises. But it was, it took its

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
cue from the joke because the speech was kind of predicated and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
executed in a kind of a third-person way. Where Al Gore would go fearlessly

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
at the idea of him being stiff and boring.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So on Friday morning, I'm escorted by Lorraine to the West Wing to meet

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
with the Vice President. He's standing outside his office waiting for me.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
He says, "Welcome to the Square Office of the Vice President." [laughter]

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It was, you know, kind of a prepared joke but I appreciated just the same and we walk in, and on his

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
wall I see the picture, a famous picture of the earth as big blue marble.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And I noticed it because my freshman year roommate had the same picture up and I immediately had a 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
flashback. And he says, uh, uh, "You like that photograph?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I took it

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
myself." [laughter] You know. Just one of the prepared jokes. But, look, I, I

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
was impressed with the guy because of the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
two of us, him the second ranking constitutional officer in the United States, and me an itinerant wise  

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
ass of the two of us, He was the one who was huffing it to show me how funny he was.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.000
[laughter] That's

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
when I knew I liked Al Gore. [laughter] So he says, uh, so we sit down for this meeting, he says, uh,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
"Do you have any ideas for an opening bit?"

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Now I was actually taken aback because bit is kind of comedy parlance.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And I said, just to show I shot back I just said, uh, a joke, I want to see if I can make him laugh, I said,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
"Yeah, yeah, we're going to, uh, uh, put you out in a hand truck and wheel you out to the podium."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
He says, "I love

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
it!" [laughter]

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Now I'm struggling to catch up to him because I just said as a joke to see if I can make him laugh,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
he actually beat me to the actual idea. And I'm struggling to catch up, I'm like, "Oh, yes, wait a second,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
let's actually put Al Gore in a hand truck and roll him out to the podium and, uh,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
yes, this is brilliant! Good God I am a genius!"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.000
[laughter]

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So now we sit down to go over the speech and, uh, you know, explain, uh, the premise of the speech and then

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
we get to the section where he tells his favorite Al Gore jokes. And the beauty of it

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
is, the premise, he's just repeating jokes, he doesn't need to know if they

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
were original or not, they're just jokes that are his favorite jokes. The bit begins with, uh, "By

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
now I've heard them all.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Al Gore is so stiff that racks buy their suits off of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
him." [laughter] OK...Thank you.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
"Al Gore is an inspiration to the millions of Americans who suffer from Dutch elms

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
disease." [laughter] And now I'm holding my breath because I know what joke is coming next.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And he reads it. "Al Gore is so boring-"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
He can't get through the joke, he starts vibrating with laughter, so - [wheezing laugh]

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
He's laughing so hard. And I'm struggling to make sense of this because I was nine tenths sure.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
he was gonna say, "Yeah, you know, people've been telling me the joke all week, coming up to me, because they saw it on the Today Show."

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
This guy had crisscrossed the country twice

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Since that joke was on The Today Show and no one had brought it to his attention. And I'm trying to -

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Struggling struggling struggling to figure out what I

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
- was it really on the Today Show? Did I just imagine hearing it on the

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Today Show?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And if I did, isn't that the same thing as writing it? [laughter]

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we go through - so this is the fevered pitch monologue that's going on through my head

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
he continues reading through the speech and he gets to the end of it.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And we read through it once more time- One more time and  he goes through it and picks out

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
his favorite joke. You'll never guess which!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Lorraine says, that's a great joke, isn't it?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
He says "yes". He's looking through the speech

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
He says "These are all jokes you wrote?"

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Well I'd gotten this far into the week without sinking to an explicitly stated lie.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I just let this assumption go uncorrected day after day after day.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
was burdened by it.I wished it was not - I never intended to steal this joke. But I just never could

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
find the moment - the right moment - to give back the credit. I didn't know how to do it I was

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
stuck with this joke and it was weighing heavily on me. But now the vice president had given me

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the perfect opportunity to come clean.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Except Lorraine was standing right there and I would've had to revealmyself to her as a weasel.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
That's when I heard myself say

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
this. Mr Vice President, I'm just a ghost writer.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
As far as I'm concerned You wrote these

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
jokes. [clapping]

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Now I am not proud of what I said,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But even as those words left my lips. Their brilliance

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
stunned me.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Deploying false humility to let a false hood stand. Was at least as brilliant

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
as the joke I was in the process of

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
stealing. And just as a political maneuver. Was worthy of my

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
current surroundings, the West Wing of the White House.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
"Good answer." Al Gore said. Al Gore did not know the half of it. The next night

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Al Gore and I put on our white tie and tails and go to the Gridiron Club. Now I must explain

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to you what this is - three hundred of the most important people you can fit into a room

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
in Washington. Supreme Court

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Justices, the entire Cabinent, The Joint Chiefs of Staff. I mean just to give you

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
a sense of this room. Congressmen are checking coats at the Gridiron

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Club. And Al Gore gets up to give a speech and you know from

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
the very moment he was rolled out on a hand truck - and two guys wearing a

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
U.P.S.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
uniform and signed for by the Gridiron Club - set off the speech with

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
loud uproarious laughter that did not abate for

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
the next twenty minutes. And I will spare you the many glorious details

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
of one of the great nights of my life. Except to say this. On the next day the front page

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
of The Washington Post aisle section had this headline in big bold type.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
AL GORE: BORE NO MORE! [applause]

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
You're very kind. If there was any disappointment at all to the speech was the fact that.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
right after the speech vice president had to leave early, hop on Air Force Two to go to some

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
to a hemispheric

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
summit. Global warming if I had to guess.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So we never got that moment after the speech to kind of high five in and share and enjoy this

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
This celebration of our This joint

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
accomplishment of ours.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So I go back to New York the next day enjoying my trip on the Amtrak train. And

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
taking pleasure in the speech I had written on the way down.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And I get a phone call from Lorraine a few days later - he's back from his trip, he's going to be up in

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
New York and asked to see me. He's going to speaking and asked if I would come to the speech. So I

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
take time out of my schedule as an unemployed copywriter

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
to put on a suit and tie and go to the Essex House and I tell 'em my

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
name at the door and I'm escorted to a V.I.P. room where they're five hundred people going to hear him speak.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But there's a dozen or so people been invited to meet with him before he does and in this room are the local

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
dignitaries and celebrities in fact - by the bar - I see Richard Dreyfus.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And actually I'm very excited to see him because I had just seen the

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
movie What About Bob? which is hysterical, a revelation of humor. And

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I was excited to talk to him about it. So I, you know, we're all peers here in the V.I.P. room so I sidled up

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
to the bar and introduce myself and start  asking about What

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
About Bob? Well you know I should have taken the cue, he was wearing his very serious, bookish,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
thick glasses that says "you know, I'm a serious person here to talk to Vice President about serious things. He had no

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
time for me.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So I back away. A minute later the Vice president walks into the room.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I see him coming, he's coming in my direction but I assume he wants to talk to Chuck Schumer

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
over here or, you know, Charles Wrangle over here. But no, he's coming right at me and.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I only have time - I have a glass of red wine in my right hand I switch it to my left hand so I

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
can you know give him a good- this is a long overdue celebration, I want to give him a good handshake.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I underestimated Al Gore's enthusiasm to see me, because he reaches down.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Picks me up gives me a flying bear hug.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Hey, Hey, My Real my legs go flying out like I'm a rag doll.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The wine in my hand spills all over the place

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
he pays it no-never-mind, in fact it was right then and there that a Secret Service guy dove in and took

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
stain. [laughter] That joke I did write!

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So now we're going over the speech like it happened Five MINUTES AGO. He's telling me what it was

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
like to do. From the front of the room I'm telling him how loud the last word was in the back of the room. Were going through a line by line

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that was it joked with it. That joke was at nine that joke was a ten.  We're going through it line by line.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Finally we get to the end of the speech and we're done congratulating ourselves and he said a quick hello to the other

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
people in the. V.I.P. room. And as we're all filing out

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
To go hear the speech he's there to give and the five hundred people are waiting patiently to hear.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Richard Dreyfus turns to me and says

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
"Tell me who you are 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
again". And I told him my name but not

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
what I was

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
thinking. What I was thinking was: I'm the guy who wrote the

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
speech that Al Gore knocked out of the

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
park. I'm the guy who's going to be writing humor speeches for the president of the

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
United States of America. For the next four to eight years.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Who am I? Who-am-I?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I'll tell you who I am.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I'm the guy who wrote the joke. Al Gore is so boring his Secret Service code name is

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Al Gore! Thank you very much.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000
very much.
