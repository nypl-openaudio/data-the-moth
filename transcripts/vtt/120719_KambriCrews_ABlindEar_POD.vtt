00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[applause]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So I grew up in a deaf family. My mom is deaf. My dad is deaf.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My mom's parents are deaf. Almost all my aunts and uncles they were all born deaf.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And this usually prompts a lot of questions. I'm sure you've got some, so you know what?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm just going to answer the top three questions that I usually get

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when people find this out so we can just get that out of the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
way. Yes. I know sign language.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I learned how to talk. Because I'm not deaf.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And yes, I'll teach you all the dirty words, but after the show.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now when I was seven years old my dad moved us to the woods of Texas. And I say woods - but this was snake-infested forest.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And we camped in tents. We didn't have running water - no electricity.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We didn't have plumbing so we used an outhouse. And we did all this while we were

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
clearing the land preparing for the arrival of a trailer. And

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
eventually my dad built us a one room tin shack that we all shared.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And my dad led this expedition for this trailer

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and he dug a water line that tapped into a natural spring well.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He dug a septic tank and created a plumbing system so we didn't need that nasty outhouse

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
anymore. He even brought us electricity. He did this all on his

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
own and to me as a kid, man, this was like

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
he was like Daniel Boone and Frank Lloyd Wright and Ben Franklin just

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
all rolled into one. And I was his baby girl.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
He would have done anything for me including risk his life.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
There was this one time on the ride back from Galveston Beach. And I was riding

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in the back of our Chevy pickup truck. And my flip flop just tumbled out of sight. I

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
don't even know how I lost it. But, but seeing it tumble down the Houston highway made me burst

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
into tears. And my dad saw

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this - saw me crying in the rearview. And he would have none of that so he brought the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Chevy to a screeching halt. Backed up down the highway. Jumped out

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and ran across four lanes of traffic.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Cars are swerving, dodging people, screaming and honking, it was

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
mayhem. And I wasn't crying anymore. And my dad - he got that flip flop - he raised

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
it up like a trophy and he ran back, swerving through, dodging cars. And

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
he was -  he, he gave it back to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
me. And he said, "Don't cry, baby girl. Don't cry."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
He was a superhero. And he was my

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
dad. But he was also a husband, and not a very good one

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
according to my mother. After 22 years of marriage she had gotten fed up with the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
spontaneous lifestyle of his - this wild life of the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
party and, you know, the financial troubles that came with it. Oh, we had gotten the trailer,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but the trailer got repossessed. And we moved back into that one-room tin shack.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And so we relocated to Fort Worth. My mom and I shared a, a two-bedroom apartment and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
my dad got some crappy studio down the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
street. And, now I knew about the money troubles because as a child of deaf

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
adults or a CODA, I answered the phone. And

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I interpreted the bill collectors' calls. I negotiated payments. So I knew

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
about this side of this, their, their troubles.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But I didn't really know about their fighting. Because unlike hearing parents who might

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
shout you would overhear shouting. I didn't hear them because they fought behind closed doors.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I also didn't see them.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But, uh, one

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
night. One night I did see them fight. It was August 15th, 1988,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and something woke me up. Which, as a CODA,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
should have been a signal that something was not right. Because, you know, one of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the, the false assumptions about deaf people, is that they're quiet? No.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
They have no regulation at sounds. They are burping and slamming cabinets

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and banging pots and pans. They are noxiously loud. And as a CODA,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you just tune out

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the sounds of everyday life. But this night, is like

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
three in the morning. And something woke me up, and I went to investigate. And I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
saw the light was on in my mom's bedroom.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I peered in, and I see her lying on the floor. And my dad

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is straddling her, and his arm is cocked back, ready to punch. And, and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
seeing me in the doorway made my mom, like, shift her head. And in that split second

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
my dad ?[slapping sound]? hit the floor.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And the- missed her face by a fraction of an inch. If I hadn't been in

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the doorway he surely would have hit her. And in hearing this thunderous crack of his knuckles

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
on the concrete floor, with that cheap carpeting over it - it stunned me and,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and I just backed up away from them. They scrambled to their feet and everyone's screaming and crying,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
my dad is threatening to kill her and then kill himself.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And I have never seen my dad hit my mom. I've never had him lay

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a hand on me. He never spanked me my whole life.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This was terrorizing. So I raced to my

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
bedroom and I called 911.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Now my first instinct was to protect my dad.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
See in the deaf community, stories were often circulated about

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
how, um, the police would show up and a deaf man wouldn't know that the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
police were commanding them to stop, or drop their weapon, or put their hands up. And the deaf

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
person of course didn't know that they were being yelled at and so didn't obey these commands and they were shot dead.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This is a story that I would hear all the time. And so my first thought to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the operator was please make sure, make sure that the cops know that my dad is deaf

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and he might not do what they say. But I'll be here, I'll take care of it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And so I tell my parents that the cops are on the way and then they calm down and they sit in the dining room and

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that's when I noticed there are holes all over the dining room wall. And, uh,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I think well, maybe that's what woke me up. I don't know, but when the cops arrive,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
they don't care about the holes in the wall. They don't care what I witnessed. They don't care

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
about what the 911 operator told them. All they really wanted to know

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
was the status of my parents' relationship - were they still married.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Now. Yeah. Technically they were still married. You know, they were separated, my dad -

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
his name isn't even on the lease, I told them. Well, that didn't matter. Did he have personal

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
belongings here? Well, yeah, he had

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
some clothes hanging in the closet, and toiletries. Well,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that gave him a right to be there.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The laws were different then. This is before the Violence Against Women Act. This is 1988.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And what happened behind a family's closed doors was their business - a weird don't ask, don't

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
tell policy.  He, therefore, had a right to be there.  All they could

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
do was ask him to leave. Ask him to leave, not tell him.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So after twenty minutes of negotiating, my dad finally says, "Okay, fine. I'll 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
go." And the cops assure me that they will follow him and make sure he's out

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
of harm's way, our way, even though he was clearly blitzed and in no condition to drive.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But hey, if they didn't care, I didn't care, and they were

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
gone. And my mom and I just, we didn't even hug.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We were just shocked, stunned I guess, and, and uh, we just went back to

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
our bedrooms. I mean, like, what do you, what do you after you've witnessed this?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Go to sleep. So I'm waiting. Trying

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to fall asleep. But the adrenaline's still pumping through me, and, I'm thinking about working the next

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
morning and, and that's when I hear just this tremendous

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
crash. And I leap out of bed, and I see my dad charging down the hallway straight at me

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and one body slam he has knocked the front door completely off its hinges.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Just destroyed it. And I grab this rotary phone that's sitting by my

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
bed and I start to dial 911 which, I gotta say in the

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
age of rotary phones. Nine?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Really stupid number, to have to dial in an emergency.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It hasn't even gotten back to its starting position and my dad's already

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
reached me. He's got the cord in his hands like he's going to crack a bullwhip. You know and he goes 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
like that, and rips it right out of the wall.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
He corrals us and pushes us into the dining room and he makes me and my mom and him sit there while

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
he interrogates my mother about who she's sleeping with.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I, you know I can't hear them fight, obviously, so I just cover my eyes. This is a way to,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I guess, maintain some dignity for my mother and also because I don't want to know these details about

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
my parents'

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
relationship. And hours pass, and I can see that the sun is

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
rising - I'm not going to work in the morning. And my mother is not giving my father any

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
father any emotion - she's just a blank slate. And this starts

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to, I guess just get on my dad's nerves to the point where he decides to turn his

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
attention to me. He wants to make sure that I know what a horrible human she

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
human she is and what a horrible wife she is. And he starts

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
he starts to graphically describe her sex life to me. Your mother

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Your mother is an S L U T

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I search his face

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I search his face for a sign of who, who, who

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
is this person? Where is my

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
dad. And he's searching my face. For a sign that

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I'm on his side. And I wasn't. This made

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
him snap. He grabs my mother by the neck in one move, slams her against the wall

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and starts choking her to death

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
death. And her heels are like digging into the wall like she's trying to pull herself up

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and she's got her hands around his wrist like, just trying to get some leverage - anything.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And I think,OK, what can I do I? I can grab a finger, if I can just grab

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
one finger and bend it backwards, he'll have to let go from the pain so I just try to focus on just

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
one finger. If I could get my fingers behind one finger. And I

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And I couldn't. He was so strong. He was too strong. And my mom's face is turning purple, her

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
eyes are bugged out, and the vein on her forehead is fat and

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
burst and so I change tactics. I, he's so focused on my mom

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
my mom's eyes that I get between their faces and I make my dad look at me. Look at 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
"Look at

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
me. It's Kambri, your baby girl."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And his eyes start to well up with tears. And I see, oh, it's working, it's working. I'm gonna keep doing

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
keep doing this. So I keep saying it. "It's Kambri. It's me, your baby girl. Your baby girl."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And with that,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
he just lets her go. So I race to the dining room phone, which thank God was a

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
was a touch tone. And dialed 911. And I

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
hear the operator say, like, "911, this is an emergency" or "What's your emergency?"

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Um, but my dad, he's already reached me. He grabs the phone and slams it into

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
the cradle. He grabs my mother by the back of her hair, forces her into a seat

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and pulls her head back and now has a knife that he's pulled out of his back pocket, at her throat, that

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
he's made long and lean.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
But since he's deaf, what he doesn't know is that the whole time, the phone is ringing.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
911 had called immediately back.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And I have a choice. This whole time I'm thinking, I have a choice. I can either

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
try this baby daughter routine, or I can grab the phone. And I

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And I know the baby daughter routine won't work. I'm the enemy now. He

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
sees this. So, I made a choice and I ran for the phone and I screamed, "He's back!"

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And in that instant, seeing my mouth moving, my dad, he knew the jig was up. He knew it was done. So

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
he dropped the knife and tried to make everything look like it was in order again.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And the cops, they were there in a blurry instant. And one officer is

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
tending to my mother. And while

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
they're working with her, the other one asks me to interpret my father's Miranda rights.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
father's Miranda rights. So I 

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
start to interpret them. You have the right to remain silent.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And that's when the other officer is like, "Oh, maybe we can do that back at the station."

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yeah. Maybe.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And they off, tromp through the front door.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And they left me and my mom just to pick up the pieces, and for a variety

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of reasons my mother didn't press charges. And because of the laws being what they were then,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
my father was never really charged with anything too serious. He, he got four years probation.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And over time, I discovered

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
discovered that my father had been a cheat from day one. My mom - he had cheated

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
on my mom the day they were married -  the whole first year of their

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
marriage. He had been abusing her, the whole time too, but

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
because she used to make him fight behind closed doors where I couldn't hear and I couldn't

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
couldn't see, I didn't know these things. And so she had given

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
me this superhero of a dad. This -

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
crazy memories of

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
just this wild carefree father. And that's the one that I have

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to choose to remember. That Daniel Boone, that Ben Franklin, and

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Frank Lloyd Wright. All wrapped into one.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
one. The father who would rescue

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
rescue my flip flop.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Because he thought it meant something to me.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Thank you.
