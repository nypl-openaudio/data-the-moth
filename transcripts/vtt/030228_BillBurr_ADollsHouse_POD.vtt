00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All right, thank you very much. All right. This is my story.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was dating this girl, like, two years

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
ago. I'd been dating her for, like, eight months, and she wanted to meet my parents. She was really give me shit

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like, "how come I haven't met your parents?".

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And uh, you know, I

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
always just - I never, liked - you know, I never brought anybody home to meet my parents. I was like 30 years

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
old. Never met - brought anybody

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
home. Never - I didn't ever like meeting people in general. [LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I didn't want to meet her parents. I always hate it when you had to meet, like - you know, go out with somebody you have to, like, meet

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
their friends and shit. You know, sitting at the table

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
trying to be interesting. I usually end up just sitting there staring at my  mashed potatoes or some shit.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So she's like, you know, "how come - what's wrong with you?".

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You know, "How come you don't want to meet me," you know,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
bring me home to meet your parents? I started thinking about it. Like, you know, not only had I never brought 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
anybody home - you know, a girl home - and I was 30 years old - I never brought anybody

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
home - even, like, back in, like, first grade,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Like second grade I mean I had friends and shit I just never brought him home.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 So I started thinking, like, you know, how the hell did that start? You know? So basically 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So we're basically driving up from New York to go to my house to finally, um, meet my parents. And

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
uh, I remember, like, I think it was like when I was in first grade. We used to have a bus

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
right out front of my house, and my parents used to always be arguing. And my dad was like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
a maniac, you know. Always screaming "God damn fucking bitch!". You know?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Just total psycho. My dad was like a complete psychopath.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You know? Like his nickname in my house was called The Thing. Because that's what he was,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
fucking thing, that, like, if he wasn't around, we'd say "Dude, is the Thing home?". You know, like,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
if he wasn't home, we could chill. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
He was just, like, never in a good mood. So one day I'm down at the bus stop, there's like, you know, ten other kids down there

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 and shit. And we're all, like, in first grade, second grade, 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
third grade, waiting for the bus. And it's, like, towards the summertime, so my parents got like the windows open and shit. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So I can start to hear, like, an argument start, like, "well what the fuck do you mean..."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I'm sitting there going "please, please let the bus come, please"

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"Please please, let the bus come, please, for Christ sake" and all the sudden, "YOU GODDAMN FUCKING BITCH!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Bleh bleh! Screamin and shit

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and I remember just looking at all the other kids' looks on their faces like, I guess, you know,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so most kids never even heard curses. So they couldn't believe it 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 couldn't believe it and I was just -- that's when it really 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that man, my family's really, really screwed up.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And, uh, I started going over other kids' houses and their parents seemed to get

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
along, and they were like cool. And, uh, so the whole time I'm driving back

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
back and my girlfriend coming up, all this stuff was like coming back, and I'm thinkin.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I really like all like like I'm a six year old kid again like getting all nervous. Like how my

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
dad is going to like act

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
'cause it's like embarrassing. You know, I mean.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I remember like like he was one of these dues where like, uh, I don't know, he was always in a bad mood

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
like he'd try to like teach you something he'd say it once.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And then when you didn't get it he'd just say it louder and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
louder. And I remember at six going this guy, he's retarded. Like, I remember

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We got a dog and he's trying to teach this dog how to sit. All right. It's a dog

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
it doesn't speak English and he's sitting there goin' to the thing, he's like going to the thing like, 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
alright, "Sit." to this little puppy, "Sit!"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
"SIT DOWN. YOU'RE GOING TO GET OVER THERE AND YOU'RE GONNA SIT DOWN!"

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Dog's sitting there, like, walking around like peeing like "what the fuck is wrong with this guy?"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And that was, like, his thing, man.Everything, like, in my house, my parents, they were like were ridiculously strict. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
They had all these stupid rules, like I remember they had like this one rule whatever you didn't eat for dinner, They would just like wrap

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 it in cellophane and you had to like eat it the next morning for breakfast.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And it's like everybody's sitting eating their, like, pancakes and waffles and you're like 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
eating cube steaks and shit.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Dad would be going, 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Come on, EAT IT! I don't want to eat it. EAT IT. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So I'm like, driving back and that's all I'm thinking is like, aw, this guy is going to completely embarrass me

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and, uh, I don't know, like, it's just I just felt

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
weird, like my family was like, like the -- you know those families that loving, like

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
build somebody up. Like our family just always just like ripping somebody down

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
like uh I think the worst thing he ever

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
did to me. This is the want to really kind of made me like the anxious, worrysome

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
person that I am, you know, uh, it was right around Christmas, and I was already thinking this

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
because I was driving this girl up for Christmas. He, uh,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He was giving me shit one day, he always

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
hated when I was joking around. I think making my mother laugh, somehow I don't knoe bug him or whatever

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So he kept giving me shit, "Come on man you know. You keep joking around, you know

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Giggling all the time -- you're acting like a little girl." and I'm thinking, like,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And I'm thinking like -- because he's always fucking with me -- Oh, God, here's a new angle. You know, you ask him for a football for Christmas

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
act like a little girl? What the fuck's wrong with you?" And I'm just sitting there like, oh Jesus. So, like, two weeks later,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So like two weeks later, it's Christmas time. I've got like four brothers, right? We always sneak down

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
o go look at the presents. So we go downstairs, right? There's all these gifts down there

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
all wrapped and we're all looking to see who got what you know. There's all these little tags, like, "To: Ed, From: Santa."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Santa." [clears throat]

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You know. Be like "To Bob 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000
"To: Bob, From: Mom and Dad." Or whatever. And I'm sitting there

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Phew. Just wait a second.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
[Breathing]

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So I look

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In like, the middle of

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the tree, I see there's a doll

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And I'm thinking, I got four brothers what the fuck is there a doll

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
sitting here? And I remember just

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
looking at this thing. Do you ever see those Spike Lee movies were, like, the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
like the background moves and the character doesn't?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It was like one of those deals.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And I look up at this doll, right? And it says, "To: Bill, From: Santa."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Santa"

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And I'm like, "what the fuck?" Guy

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
got me a goddamn doll. He came downstairs and he's laughing and shit and he's making me take a picture and I'm like

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
six years old and I'm crying and stuff, and uh,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and I'm thinking of this shit as I'm pulling up into the driveway, and

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I'm like freaking out because I'm finally going to bring somebody home to meet

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
this fuckin maniac.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And, uh, I'm telling her you know, "I don't know how this guy's gonna 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So we walk into the house and it's like

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
you know, It's like, uh, 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Candles and shit. You know Christmas tree, it's all real nice,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
dim lights and stuff. She comes in she meets my dad, and the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
dude is like totally normal. After me 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
building this guy up the whole ride back. He's like fuckin like, you know that dude from Leave It

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
to Beaver. He's like the nicest guy ever.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He's all cordial. And I 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
remember, I'm just getting like pissed at the guy, going, why isn't he being a

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
dick?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And she's sitting there, like, taking me aside, going, he's the greatest

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
guy and I can't believe you were saying all that stuff, he's such, he's you know, smart, he's intelligent,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
he's so interested

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
in what I have to say. And I remember, I was like, I was

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
like so pissed at the guy.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I mean I really hated him when I was growing up to the point of one time. He went on

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the driveway and he's running out to his car. And he slipped and fell and broke his shoulder

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And at that point me and my brothers so fuckin' hated this guy, when he came to the house and mom was like taking care of him,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
we snuck out the back

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
door to look at his footprints in the snow, to see where he slipped and fell, and I'm telling you

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
we were laughing our asses off at this guy.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
"Right there, right there, that's where... Fuck! Why couldn't I have seen that?"

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So, uh

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So uh, he ended up being 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
like the sweetest guy ever and there was nothing anxious about it. I like worried about it for like, I don't know,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
From the beginning of time dating girls, like fifteen, and I just ended up feeling really stupid.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And, uh, I was kind of pissed I was just looking at the guy, going

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Why the fuck couldn't you have been

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
like this you know twenty years ago when I needed him to be like that

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that rather than you know

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
being the way he was? And, uh,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that's my story. Thanks.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Thank you.
