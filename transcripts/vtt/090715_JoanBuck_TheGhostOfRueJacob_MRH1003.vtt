00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I don't know. Hi.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So they say that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
ghosts

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
are people caught between two

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
worlds. I'm caught between two worlds.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm an American who passes for a French person. This makes me really rare.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 It also means

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I don't know if I'm American or French. It also means that fifteen years

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
ago, I was asked to go to Paris as editor in chief of Paris Vogue. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The first time an American has ever been asked to edit a French publication. And the last

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(applause)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I, I wasn't used to working in offices. I hadn't

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
had a desk job at that point for

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
years. And so I had to go to Paris and act like a grown up. And I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
also needed to work very hard, but worse than that I had to find an apartment

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that would be fitting for my station. So I

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
looked at a lot of apartments, and they were too big or too small or too dingy or too

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
dark or, all of them, too ordinary. Until one day. I was in

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the Rue Jacob.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Every American's favorite Paris street. The Rue Jacob

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
was picturesque.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's on the left bank, and it's easy to pronounce - Jacob. And it's full

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
of antique shops that have very beautiful objects in them. Objects that you would

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
want to put in your very beautiful apartment on the Rue Jacob, if you could find such a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
thing, which I did. Up a stone staircase from the seventeenth

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
century, the color of honey or freshly baked bread.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Two gigantic lacquered doors opened into a foyer. And there was

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
a dining room on the right. And then there was a living room:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Eighteen feet wide, eighteen feet long, and eighteen feet high.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
A perfect cube. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And next to it was an American kitchen, the realtor said. I was reassured. And there

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
was a study. There was a long corridor, and at the end of that was a bedroom that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
was another perfect cube. All of this perfection covered

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in moldings from the late 18th century, 5 minutes before the revolution.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The place was perfect. Also,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
fifteen years ago, this perfection, this palace cost only two hundred dollars

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
more than my rather dingy boring apartment on the Upper East Side.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So I found myself in the office of the pair of rather peculiar

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
lawyers near the "Place de Peace"?? and they put this piece of paper on the desk.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and they read. They

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
said,  "Madam, you must hereby attest that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we have informed you on this day that the apartment situated at 11 Rue Jacob...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
moves at night.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Please sign here and initial on top." So I sign. I initial. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They also warned me that,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
given who I was and what I was doing in Paris, I would certainly be giving parties in this magnificent apartment,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
if I could possibly keep the more corpulent guests

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
around the perimeter because they couldn't really vouch for the safety of the middle of the floor.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the possessor of this very beautiful rental, I move in. I figure out that 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'm going to put the bed on the wall that's between, there's this wall between the study and the bedroom, 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 I put the bed there. What am I going to do about the very high windows?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Oh! Beige felt curtains.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Felt -- cheap, practical. And all the French people say, "Oh, that is so intelligent. Felt!" And

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I give a party and I keep the more corpulent people around the perimeter and there's an exceptionally

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
fat Italian designer who I keep by the window. I ask him to "please, will you

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
make sure to tell me who's coming?"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And, these parties are not

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
really parties, they're work. Everything is work. I'm working twenty hours a day. So that when I come

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
home to bed, I crash.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I sleep like a dead person. After four months, I realize I don't 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
have to work twenty hours a day, I can work nineteen hours a day. So I'm beginning to get a bit more normal

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and that's when

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in the middle of the night, one night, I awaken because

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
there is a pool on the bed clothes on my left as if

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
somebody is lying on the covers next to me.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And there's a soft little hand touching my forehead.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 And I lie there wondering

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
if somebody is actually in the room. And with a great act of courage

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I put out my arm and I turn on the light and there is no one there.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now, I'm the Editor in Chief of Paris Vogue. I absolutely refuse to believe that any of this

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
nonsense is happening. It's ridiculous. However, the next day I

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
do go around the corner to the church of St. Germain des Pres.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And, I'm

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
not quite sure how you do these things, but I go into the office and there's a woman there making

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
notes in a little notebook, and I wait.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 And she looks up, she has me for my name. I give a fake name because, you know, I don't want people

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
to know that I think what I'm about to tell her. And it's not the right kind of name: she looks

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
at me skeptically. And I say "I live around the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
corner, and I think my apartment is maybe haunted. Is there a priest who could come and..."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the woman,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 who's got a greasy bun and greasy glasses looks at me through the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
greasy glasses, with

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
total contempt. And she says, "Madam, that is superstition!"

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So I leave the church of St. Germain des Pres, and I know one thing: I'm not going to let a single 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
person in Paris know that I'm crazy enough to think

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that there's something in my bedroom at night. So I go

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
back. Ha. I give another party. Everybody says it's so

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
wonderful. And, uh, I don't tell

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
anyone what happens at night in my room.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And, in fact, I'm really lonely. So, you know, it's 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
not bad.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
(applause. laughter.)

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So, one June morning. A cold freezing June

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
morning, I wake up-- one of those horrible grey

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 French June mornings -- and I turn on my light and there's no electricity and I think, "Oh my

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
God, I forgot to pay the bill and they've cut me off." The French, they're always punishing you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So I go to the office. I get the bill paid. That evening, I have

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
dinner with friends who are Italian. They're really nice. I've known them

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
a long time. Maybe I can confide in them. And I do. And the wife says,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"Wait a second. You have no electricity. You have something in your bedroom. And

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you're going home tonight and you're going to like, go to your bedroom with

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
the candle? No no. Come stay with us tonight." I say, "Great. Great. Thank you very much.  

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Can I please just pack a little bag?" So we go back to my apartment. We put the husband in the living room

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
with some tequila. And the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
wife says, "Let's take a look at this ghost of yours." So I walk down the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
long corridor with two votive candles. And I know there's nothing to see because I've never

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
seen anything.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And we go into the bedroom and I turn to face the bed. And there on the bed I

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
see the indentation of a body lying there.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
At that very moment the wife says, "You know what, I think I'll wait for you in the

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
living room." So, now

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I really don't know what to do because if I ask her if she's seen it, and she hasn't seen it, I'm

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
nuts. So I just let her

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 go and I put my candles down, and I pack my little

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
bag. And the next morning, the bill is paid. The electricity

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
is put on again. And  that evening, when I come home, the first thing I do: I move that bed from

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that weird wall over to the other side of the room, in front of the bricked up fireplace,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
underneath the mantelpiece that's made of marble that looks a little bit like a

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
tombstone. But it's kind of a good place for the bed. And all the

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
French people come and look at the bedroom and they say, (chuckles) "You know, you really want to sleep there? 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Because it looks like a grave!"

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And, so I lie. I say

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.000
"Oh, I really like it." And they say, "Mmm, it's very punk. Yes."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, when I'm sleeping over there nothing happens. I'm OK.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I think about the building. And the people who own the building

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
have exactly the same apartment above me. Foyer, dining room. The cube

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
living room. The study.The bedroom.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And, one October night,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I'm woken in the middle of the night by the sound of somebody

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
in the room above me

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
being thrown from one end of a wooden floor to the other and hitting the far

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
wall with a

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
thud. And then there's a scream. And then there are

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
blows, and more screams, and wails, and cries, and some kind of snorting sound. 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And the sound of the violence

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is so loud that my room is moving.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So, I put on some shoes. I put on a coat. I run downstairs to the

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
courtyard because I want to see what's

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
happening in that room above my room. And I see my pale

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
beige felt curtains in my

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
window. And above, I don't see anything. There's no noise. There's

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
nothing moving. There's no light. There's no shadows. There's just the October

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
full moon reflected in the closed windows.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So I go back up to my room. And I do what any American would do: I get out a sage stick from New

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Mexico,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and light it. And I get a shell

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and I put it on the table next to my bed and I put the sage stick in

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the shell because this is going to get rid of whatever's going on.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But, the flames jump up. The

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
flames multiply. Something in my bedroom is feeding

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the sage stick.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And it burns so bright and so hard that it

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
scorches the table. The next day, I call my neighbors. 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
My owners.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And I insist on going upstairs for a drink-- I'm going to be really brave-- and I go up, I go up the stairs.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And they offer me a really teeny glass of wine. And they show me their apartment. And it's terribly

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
neat and rather austere, just like

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
them. And I say, "So, your apartment is exactly like mine."And they say, "Yes, yes.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But of course we sleep in the dining room." I say, "Oh. Really? 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Why don't" ... "Oh, no no no. We never go into the back room. (Chuckles). No. We're

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
much happier in the dining room."

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Ok.  So now I really don't know what to do. Because I'm not going back to the Catholic Church after

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
they've humiliated me like that. But! I have a tame Tibetan

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
acupuncturist. I go to Dr Tong ?Lang? and I say, 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
"Do you ever do any exorcism?" 

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
He says, "Well not personally but I work with Lamas who can

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
clean various auras in various places just by looking at photographs."

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So I go back to my place. I photograph the bedroom. This

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
was 1997:I take the photos to be developed. You know I don't want anybody

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
at the magazine to know about this. After the fashion shows the photos are developed. I take them in

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to the Tibetan Lama-acupuncturists and he promises that he will get it to the other Lamas.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And I think, "You know, I'm out of my mind. Right?" Then my

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
father comes to stay. And he thinks the apartment is very beautiful. I

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
don't discuss anything about what I might suspect. We're

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
standing outside the apartment, outside the glorious lacquered doors one day,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and he's just standing there stock still. And suddenly,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
he's thrown down the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
stairs. And I run down. I pick him up--he's actually OK. But

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I know that

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
something from the apartment threw him down the stairs. And that's it. I go

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
to the Right Bank. I find an apartment. An ordinary nineteenth century apartment 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
With no drama about it. And everybody in Paris says,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
"You're moving to the Right Bank when you have this palace on the Rue Jacob? "

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
rouge a

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And I say, "You know what, I really think the Left Bank is just so over." (laughter). 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
they say, "You're right!" So, one day I'm in the Cafe Fleur-- I

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.000
haven't

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
quite moved yet--and there's a young designer who I

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
know vaguely who's been to the parties, who comes running up to me and says, "Cherie, you're leaving

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that apartment!" And I say, "yes." And he says. "How can you do that?" I say, "Well, you know,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
..." And he says, "Tell me something: I would do anything to live in that apartment. Have you

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
given the lease to someone else? I say, "No." He says, "Is

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
there someone else living there?" And

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I have a moment where I

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
think, mmm. And then I think he'd tell everybody.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And I know he'd tell everybody.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And he says, " Please, please, please.  I want to live in that apartment. Can I have the lease?"And I say, "Yes." 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(laughter)

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So, I give him the lease. I move to the Right Bank. I get a boyfriend. I'm no

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
longer lonely. The magazine begins to

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000
sell incredibly well. I become friends with ?Mark McLaren.?  Everything goes absolutely fabulously.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And, once in a while I go to the Rue Jacob because I would like some antiques to put in

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
my nineteenth century apartment and sometimes I pass in front of my old place and I

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
see that there's a scaffolding. I see there are painters doing extraordinary things to it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Karl Lagerfeld is apparently paying for all the

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
work. And, I never go up there.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I never run into the young designer anymore. He's nowhere to be seen. Two, three

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
years later I see him in Milan. And I say, "Hey, you're not in Paris anymore?"

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
He says, "Well, you know, I

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
never sleep in Paris. I sleep in Rome. I sleep in Milan. I sleep in Brussels. I sleep

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
in London. And I'll sleep at the airport." And I say, "Really, how's our apartment?"

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:21.000
He says, "Oh, honey. It's so

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:21.000
haunted."
