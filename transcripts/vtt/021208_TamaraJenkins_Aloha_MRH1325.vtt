00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
After my parents split up. Uh... I was living in uh... my mother's house in our

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
old house on Yarmouth road in Philadelphia with my mother and my little brother

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and one Christmas morning. I came down the stairs and underneath the tree.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There were all these really large-scale gifts and they were all addressed to me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I ripped them open. And it was luggage. In, um, all

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
different shapes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and sizes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And with this beautiful floral print, and I said, 'Oh my God, mom, there's so many of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
them.' And she said, 'Well you know when you're going on a big trip it's nice to have a matching set.'

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And I said 'Who's going on the big trip?' And she said 'You are. And

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
your little brother, you know your father gives me no help here, I'm sending you both out to California to live with him.'

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So now

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm in California and I've been living with my father for like ten years and, uh, and at this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
point I'm fifteen and my little brother's eleven. And my

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
father's sixty eight years old, he's not a young man but you know he's doing OK and we're going along and it all

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
seems, you know fine. Until one day, my father's girlfriend 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
offers him this deal, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And her name is Retta Herschfield. And she, she's a widow. A

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
two-time widow, and she she's my father's age and she's put a little money aside, not a lot, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but enough. When she says to my father, 'Look

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Manny, you can either go into old age in style, you can move into

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
my condominium complex with, with, with all the amenities and all that that affords,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
my swimming pool,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the... the laundry room and the free parking,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Me and my Hamilton collection of a limited edition Gone With the Wind plates.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Or you could continue living with those two kids of yours in that crappy rental apartment on

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
La Cienega Boulevard that you can barely afford.' So that's sort of what it came down to, either the condominium or the kids and my

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
father went with the condo.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So now it's like eighteen

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
years later, and I'm living in the East Village, and I'm like thirty three years old

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and I'm, uh, and I haven't seen my father very much during the course of this time. So

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
one day the phone rings and the answering machine picks up, and it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
my father's girlfriend's daughter, Retta Herschfield's daughter, she lives in Hawaii and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
she

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
says 'Aloha.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I just thought you should know that my mother, Retta Herschfield, has had a stroke and 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we had to hire a twenty-four hour home health care worker to attend to her

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
needs and, uh, Tammy, the fact of the matter is your father's not getting any younger

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
either and actually, uh, Tammy, the fact is he won't dress

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
himself and he's wandering around the apartment in the nude. And he's showing up at the dinner

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
table nude, and he's like a nudist, and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we're really concerned and we are paying Alonzo to take care of our mother, not your father, and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
we you know we don't think it's fair, and I don't know what kind of people you are you don't even talk to your father, you're a bunch of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
savages.' And then she said 'You know, oh and I also want you to know that your father's in the hospital. I mean it's nothing

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
serious it's apparently routine, but I just thought you should know.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Aloha.' So

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
my brother, my big brother and I, we fly out to California to meet

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
with Alonzo and to check out the situation, the home health care worker, and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
we strike up a deal with him that we're going to give him you know, we're going to kind of pool our money and we're going to give him this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
monthly payment if he continues to care for our father and he agrees to this and that's all very nice and we sign

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a little piece of paper and that's all really great, and then we go to the hospital to see my

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
father. And you know I haven't seen my father in a really long time and we get to the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
hospital and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
he's in a hospital bed, and now he's quite old, he's like eighty six years old and he's laying there and it's all

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
very sort of sarcophagus-strange feeling in the room,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And I'm... and it's silent, and then suddenly my father's eyes sort of pop open.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And he looks at me. And I look at him, and he says, you know, 'Where the hell have you been? They've had

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
me hog tied for days, get me the hell outta here.' And he starts pulling at these

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
restraints. And I start to undo him, and I try to explain to him that I've been living on the eastern

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
seaboard for the last eighteen years, and, you know I'm sorry I'm

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
late dad. So I untie

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
my father, and apparently he's going to be released in a few days and everything's set

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
with Alonzo. So my brother flies back to Boston Massachusetts where he lives.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And now everything starts happening very quickly. I'm still in Los Angeles

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and I'm actually in my hotel room and I'm preparing to leave as well. And then the phone

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
rings. 'Aloha. Tammy. I just want you to know that

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
last night our mother Retta Herschfield passed away. And we just. I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
mean we feel really terrible about this I mean we're really sad we're really sorry and we're selling the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
condo. And I just want to wish, you know you and your family good luck

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and God health and Aloha.' So now.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
My father, this deal that we made with the home health care worker is moot

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because my father has no home.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And the hospital is ready to release my father but he has nowhere to go and I immediately call my big brother.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And he immediately starts scrambling to find some sort of facility that will take care of my father

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and will receive him in a very short period of time. And I'm in Los Angeles and I'm really kind of freaking

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
out I'm stalling the hospital they're getting really mad at me because you know it's a hospital and they're explaining it's not a nursing

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
home and I can't drive and I'm in L.A. My brother calls me and he finds a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
place. And that's going to take my father, and this is a big relief so I call up

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the airlines. I call United. And I'm looking for what's called

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
a compassion discount fair. And, uh,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the woman on the phone, the United woman on the phone, she was very nice. But she explained to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
me that United doesn't offer

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
compassion. They only offer bereavement.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So if your father's still alive, I'm sorry but we can't help you, but when your

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
father does die,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
please feel free to call United and then we'll be able to take care of him then.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
OK so I end up, we're flying American, and it's the morning of the flight and I show up at the hospital, and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It's quite early in the morning, and the hospital's sort of empty and I arrive at my

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
father's room. He's all... the bed's all made, and my father's all dressed up.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But the odd thing is the way my father's dressed. He's wearing sort of a flannel shirt and he's

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
wearing these suspenders. And this kind of baseball

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
cap. This does not suit my father this does not illustrate my

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
father's personality all. I mean it has nothing to do with my father. He was a nightclub owner and then he was a car salesman and,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and he does, this is like generic grandpa wear, and also my father is a

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Jew and they don't wear those sorts of things. Suspenders

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and flannel shirts and it was very strange and I was very uncomfortable with it because I thought that my father was sort

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
of losing a sense of

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
identity. You know, through this aging process, and people were buying him clothes and they didn't know who he was so

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I pulled off the cap and I pulled off the suspenders and I wheel my father out to the nursing station and

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm signing him out, you know then they're giving me like, medication and dosage instructions, and

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
they're very kind and then they start stuffing my carry-on luggage with diapers.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
These adult diapers which I was completely unprepared for but I didn't have time to ask any questions and we, you

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
know, we had a plane to catch. So I'm rolling my father out of the hospital. And then I'm

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
like, 'Dad. By the way, do you know where we're

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
going?' And he says. 'Yeah. We're going back East.' And he sort

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
of laughs diabolically like I'm springing him from the penitentiary or something.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So OK, so we get to the airport and you know we're doing pretty well, and we arrive at the

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
security check out point. And I'm putting all of our, you know, carry

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
on luggage on that conveyor belt to be X-rayed,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and somehow in the course of negotiating all of this I've misplaced my

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
father. And then I look beyond the security point, my father's

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
already gone through. And he's out there in a wheelchair and it's kind of it's like

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
he's rolling it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And they're checking me to see what I've got on me, and I'm trying to explain to them my father is

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
rolling away.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And they don't care, and then there's nothing I can do and at that moment I just I

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
realize actually you know, that, um, he is kind of helpless, and there is nothing that

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I can

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
do. And, but I'm going to do the best I can. And so

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I catch up with him and I get to the gate. And we arrive at the gate. And they're boarding the plane.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And then there's that moment where you realize, like OK. A wheelchair is like, this wide.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And like, an airplane aisle is like, this wide. So how do people in

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
wheelchairs get aboard

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
airplanes? And I'll tell you, they have the thing, it's quite, it's this thing and they pull it out of nowhere, it's sort of like

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a wheelchair and like a gurney and like a

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
skateboard. And it's very low and narrow and they take my father off of the wheelchair and they put him

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
on to this skateboard gurney

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
thing. And they strap him on, they tilt him back, and they roll him into coach. So there

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
we are, now we're, we're sitting in coach and my father's got the window seat which is lovely and

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I've got, you know I'm sitting there, and anyway the thing is that we're on the plane and that we made it and that we

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
actually we look like people on a

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
plane. And you know we're like passing. and

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We peel back

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the entrees and we're eating our fettucini

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
or Alfredo or whatever, and it's quite nice. And suddenly,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
my father's fork goes down.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And then he starts tugging at his seat belt, and I say, you know, 'Dad - What?' And he says:

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
'Bathroom.' And so we're at the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
point in the plane ride where the tray tables are down and that little service cart thing is in the

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
aisle

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and everybody's eating and taking up space. My father has to go to the bathroom and I... OK. So I managed to sort

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
of wiggle him out from behind those little flappy tray tables. I get him out into the aisle.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I... and he's very... you know, unstable and I'm not really sure how we're going to get from where we are to back there

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
where the bathroom is.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And then I think you know I'll be like one of those aluminum walkers that you see the elderly with and I

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
will become a human walker. And I face my father towards me and I hold him in

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
his hands like this and I just want to do this with as much, you know, like a private

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
dignified moment as much as I can.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And we're sort of, you know we're walking backwards towards the bathroom and it's going pretty well

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
actually, I mean it's a little shaky and it's this kind of odd little thing but nobody really seems to suspect

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
anything. And you know it seems to be OK and then suddenly my father sort of sticks in place

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and he stops walking. And I look down to discover that his pants are around

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
his ankles. And that he's standing in the middle of this airplane in his

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
diapers. And then I realized oh my god the suspenders were actually necessary.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They just offended my sensibility and I mean we felt

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
really [bleeped] and awful and responsible for humiliating my father, and I pull up his trousers and

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I you know kind of bunch them up in a little wad, and I kind of continue

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
backwards towards the bathroom. And finally my back is up against the bathroom door. And we kind of

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
turn him around and he's standing over the toilet. And the door's wide open. And it seems, you

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
know, fine. And then

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I'm not really sure what I need to do now I'm... 'Dad, you know, is there anything else I can

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
do for you?' And he says 'Yeah you can shut

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
the [bleeped] damn door and you know, get outta here.'

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So I shut the door, and we arrive at Logan

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Airport, horrible disgusting Logan Airport, and it's winter and it's disgusting and snowy and,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
you know, ice piles,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and wretched, and we get out to the curb, and my brother's there in his

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
little Camry. And then we pile my father into the car and we just start

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
driving towards Cambridge which is where my brother lives. And,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you know, he's found some place for my father there, and we pull up at this place it's called the

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
?Cantobridgian? Convalescent

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Center. We go in there and it is one of those places, it is a nursing home. And we check

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
my father in and it's kind of nighttime and we get him into his

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
room and tuck him into bed

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and my brother and I are leaving the room and I feel really awful like God

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
we are just really horrible people. I mean, I can't even... this horrible

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
place. And we're leaving this poor guy here overnight and I just feel

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
really [bleeped] about myself. And I took him on this plane ride and it was just

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
awful and we get to the door and my father says 'Hey... you guys.'

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We turn around and he says 'Don't forget to tip the girl on your way out

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
because they expect that in a hotel like this. [Laughter]
