00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, I'm standing by the Gowanas canal, and I'm wearing

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a disguise. I have on this long brown coat with the hood pulled up

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the a black hat that says, "Brooklyn" on the front, I have these 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
big Jackie-O

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
sunglasses. It's overcast out. So, with the sunglasses on, I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
can't really see very much, and I tell this to Esperanza. She's standing next

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to me, and like, it's kind of great that I can't see with these on, right?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It makes me seem more blind.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
She smiles, but it's this like sad little smile, and clearly

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
she thinks I'm crazy. That's because I am blind.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Even though I don't look it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it, I'm legally blind now and just getting a little more every day.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's the whole reason Esperanza is here. She's going to teach me how to use a mobility

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
cane. When she first told me that we had to do the cane training in public, I totally

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
freaked out

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
out. I was like, "People are going to see me. And then it might be people I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
know and, and then they're going to ask why am holding a blind-man cane, and I'm going to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
have to make up like a totally

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
cockamamie excuse. No, I'm not doing it."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But here we are. We're standing by the canal, and Esperanza

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is waiting, and I am not ready. I do not want to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
take out this

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
cane. I have this very distinct feeling that is soon as I do, terrible

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
things will

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
happen. I'm going to lose the rest of my vision and then I'm going to be

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
divorced and unemployed. And they're going to take my kids away. And then, before you know it,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm going to be living under the Brooklyn Bridge in a cardboard box smoking crack.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm panicking. My heart's beating like crazy, and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
my mind is scrambling. It's trying to find a way out, but

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I know that I can't outrun this moment

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
anymore. My blindness has caught up with me.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
When I was nineteen, I spent the weekend in Montauk with my boyfriend,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and we'd cuddle up at night, and he point out like the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Big Dipper and Ursa Major, and it was really weird because I couldn't see any of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
them. So, it wasn't a big deal, but it reminded me of this time when I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
was a kid and my father had dragged us all to Staten Island to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
this beach to see Halley's Comet. He was so excited about it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He kept calling it literally a once-in-a-lifetime

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
opportunity. So, he had even bought a telescope, which was like

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
so extravagant, and my mother still complains about it twenty years later. So, he

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
got the telescope. It's the middle of the night. It's freezing. We're on the beach, and he sees it, and he calls us

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
over, but when I get up to the lens, I don't see anything.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So, when I didn't see the stars in Montauk a whole decade later,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
it occurs to me that I should get my eyes checked. So, that's how I ended

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
up in the retinal specialist's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
office. I was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal disease.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's called retinitis pigmentosa.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The doctor said first I'd lose my nighttime vision and my peripheral vision and then eventually

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
my central vision, although he had no idea how long that would take. He

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
was hopeful I had another ten, fifteen years of decent vision

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
left.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
A few weeks after the diagnosis, I walked into my father's study, and I found

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
him crying. So, I had never seen my father cry before, not even when his

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
parents died or his brother. So, when I found him hunched over

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
his desk with his glasses, off wiping his eyes, it felt very

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
end of days. I mean, I had known the diagnosis was not

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
great, but seeing him cry, I realized how

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
bad it was. It really seemed insurmountable.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I hated the idea that everyone would think of me as this tragic

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
case. I was young. I was hot. I was about to have an Ivy League diploma.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I mean, the world was my fucking oyster. So, I decided I would just

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
not tell people about it.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I mean, I didn't look impaired, so, you know, they wouldn't know, unless I told them.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And I decided that if my eyes were getting handed a death sentence,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I would just make them a bucket

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
list. So, I travelled, and I joined circus school,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and I moved to Hollywood to be a movie star. Oh, I started wearing

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Russian-red lipstick

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and stilettos everywhere. It was amazing. I felt like I had

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
changed from a caterpillar into a butterfly. Admittedly, I was a very slutty a butterfly,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
but, still, I felt vital and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
vibrant. Now, because I wasn't telling anyone about my eye disease, I had to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
make up little stories to cover for all the accidents that I kept having.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, when I you know, fell down the stairs of the cast party, that

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
was because of the champagne. And when

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I couldn't find the bathroom in the dark bar, that was because I'd had one too

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
many cosmos. So, my M.O. was basically, "when all

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
else fails, plead intoxication." One night

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I went to visit this

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
aloof hipster paramour that I'd had in Hell's Kitchen,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and afterwards, he fell asleep, but I was restless, so I decided to have a smoke

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
on his fire escape.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So, I get my Marlborough Lights, and I open the window, and I sling my

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
leg out, you know, expecting it to meet the metal of the fire escape, but it

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
doesn't. It just keeps going

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
farther and farther and farther, and then suddenly, I realized something is off. And I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
jerk my body back and really quick before the balance

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
tips. The fire escape was out the other

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
window. So, I'm standing there, and I'm thinking,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
"Just a few more inches, and I would be lying on Fifty-Third Street dead

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
or broken in some disgusting way." But that

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
isn't even what bothers me most. What bothers me most is the fact that everyone would think

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I killed

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
myself because that's the only reasonable explanation

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
here. It's not like people fall out of fourth-floor windows even when they drink

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
one too many cosmos. No, everyone would think I'd kill myself,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
even, you know, the people that knew about my vision

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
loss. And I realized I wasn't in control of

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
my story, and that made me really furious and

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
really scared, and absolutely nothing changed at

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
all. Really, sometimes, you know,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
it takes more than a near-death experience to stop a lie from

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
growing. Not too long after that mishap,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I fell in love, and I got married, and I got pregnant.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
When I had my son, I was twenty-seven, and I had developed cataracts in

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
both eyes.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So, they make everything really blurry. So, I can't really read regular print anymore.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I lose a lot of depth perception, and I go color blind, and

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
my tunnel vision just keeps shrinking so that even something simple, like a handshake, is

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
really hard because, if it isn't like directly in front of my face, it just

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
falls into this gaping abyss of not seeing.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Still, I didn't tell

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
people. It was weird, but I

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
just figured that I would reach a breaking point, you know, like a

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
moment at which my blindness would be so obvious that I couldn't cover it up

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
anymore. So, I had my daughter two years after I had my son, and I thought, "This is it."

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But it wasn't. And then, my vision got so bad I couldn't see labels at

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the supermarket or, you know, sizes on clothing or forms of the doctor's office,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and I thought, "This is it." But it wasn't.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I had gotten so good at compensating and so good at lying about it, that I was able to

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
just keep pushing that moment away.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, my daughter, when she was a toddler was the kind of kid that,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
as soon as her feet touched the ground, she just took off sprinting and never

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
looked back. She was a blind mother's worst fucking

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
nightmare. I would take her to the playground, and if

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I looked away for like a

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
millisecond, she would just disappear. The problem was

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
there was no way for me to tell if it was like an actual emergency. So, she could

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
be running through the gate right into traffic, or she could just be sitting

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
down at my feet.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
One day, we're at the playground, and I look down to check my watch, and then

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I look up, and she's gone. So, instantly I'm in like a

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
deranged panic, and I'm panting. And I'm dizzy and I'm sweating

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm calling her name in like this shrill hysterical voice.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And I'm cursing myself for being such an idiot as to look away for a second.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I'm spinning in circles because I'm trying to find her, but I'm looking

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
through pinholes, so, it's really hard.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And then I hear, "Mommy!" and I look to the side, and she's there. She's right

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
there.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
She's sitting on the bench eating goldfish. She's probably been there the whole time.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And the relief is so sudden and intense, I think for a second I might

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
actually throw

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
up. But I don't, and I sit down, and I pull or onto my lap, and I'm shaking. And I

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I think, "I need a plan so that this doesn't happen again."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And for the first time, I realize I need

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
help because this stupid, relentless disease

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
will not go away, even if I ignore it and if I deny it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I find for the first time, something that is more terrifying

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
than facing my blindness, and it's much more terrifying. And it's what just happened at

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the playground.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
playground. So, I called the New York State Commission for the Blind,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and they sent over Esperanza to teach me how to use the mobility cane.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Ah, I told her to meet me by the Gowanas 'cause that's the most deserted area I can think of

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and then, just to be safe, I also wear the disguise.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
disguise. I mean, I'm totally going to change the error of my ways, but I have to do it

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
one little tiny error at a time. So, we're at the canal,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and Esperanza is waiting, and it's go time, and every fiber in me is screaming, "No, don't do

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
it drop the cane. Run

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
away!" But I think about my son, and I think about

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
my daughter, and I want to be a person they can

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
respect. And I want to be a mother that shows them they can face their problems instead

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
of running away from them, and I know the first step is just picking up the cane.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So, I take a deep breath, and I take off the rubber band that keeps it folded into

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
this little neat compact bundle,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and the cane, like, unfurls itself. All the pieces just snap

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
into place. It's like a magic trick. It's

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
so compliant, it makes me feel like it's going to make it really easy

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
on me, like it's been waiting for me to do this.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I take the handle in my hand, and I point the tip towards the

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
ground. I'm a blind woman now, and it's not pretty

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
or glamorous or exciting, but it's what I

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.000
am. And it feels kind of amazing to admit it.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Thanks Lou.
