00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Everything happens for a reason. Everything

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
happens for a reason.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm-a tell y'all now what happened to me when I asked myself, "Why

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
am I here?". I do that every day now: I ask myself, "Why am I here

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
today in front of y'all."But I'm I'm here today in front of y'all to tell you what happened when I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
asked myself "Why am I here?" several years ago. Several years ago I was

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
on tour with my band Run-DMC. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We was over in Europe. Now, we was in Europe, we was out there

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
doin' shows we was getting forty, fifty thousand dollars a night.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But for some reason, something in me wasn't right. Had

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
no idea what it was.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So on this particular evening, after the show, I got back to my room and I asked

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
myself , "Am I here just to be D.M.C.?" And I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
laid there that night, and I thought about everything that happened to me. Okay, I'm Darryl McDaniels.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I grew up in Hollis, Queens, New York. Byford and Banna is my mother and father, my brother

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Alfred.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Alfred. Oh, my mother and father worked every day to send me to every school that I went

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to, and every school that I went to was a Catholic school that they worked every day to pay for

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
me to go to, and I treated them right by coming home with straight A's every day. I

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
was the athletic kid, for me as a kid, every day -- not materially, but every day

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as a kid, it was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Christmas for me. Life couldn't be no better than growing up in Hollis, Queens. I met Joe

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and ?Jay? and we did things that young ?highs? to do. And then we call ourselves startin' a

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
rap group and we put a record out, and then the record goes number one, and we, you know, damn near

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
created hip hop, and we were the first to go gold, first to go platinum, all of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
this good stuff: Rolling Stone, MTV, and now here I am, playing in Europe, getting

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
forty, fifty-thousand dollars

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
tonight. But why am I so unhappy? I was laying

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
there and I summed up everything that was mean, I was

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
unhappy, to the point where I was so depressed.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And out of that, I became very suicidal. Now, I, I, I had

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I had suicidal thoughts. I don't think I really would have killed myself, because I did go to the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
ledge and look, and I looked and said "I ain't jumping! It's gonna hurt!"

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I put the poison in a glass and I thought about drinking the poison, and I looked and said, "I ain't drinkin' that!"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Thought about the gun, the whole nine.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But I knew something was wrong with me,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
even though life was good, because I had suicidal thoughts. So

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I was sayin', "Okay, I gotta figure out how to kill myself... no, I'm not... whatever, whatever, whatever." But then

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I came to the conclusion: I can't kill myself on the road, while we're touring,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because Run and Jay's going to be mad at me. So I'm-a just wait 'til I get

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
home. So we finish. We did what we had to do on the tour in Europe.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And I came home very depressed, didn't know what this void was in me, because

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I summed up everything about me, I'm supposed to be happy. I get in the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
car and the limo driver goes, "You wannna turn to... hear some music?" And I'm like, "Yeah, just turn

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
radio on." "You have a preference?" "No, just turn it on." So he turns the radio on.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And this was in 1997, and on the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
radio was a record called "Angel"by Sarah McLachlan.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Now look. Fame, friends, fortune, and even my family, my wife and kids

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
didn't mean nothin' to me because I was suicidal, I was depressed, I was an

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
emotional wreck.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But for some reason, when I heard that record Angel, by Sarah

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
McLachlan, something in me said "Life is beautiful. It's good to be alive."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So, for one whooooole year, all I did

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
was listen-listen

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to Sarah McLachlan's record "Angel."For one whole year. And not only that, I went out

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and bought every record she ever made.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And the only thing that I was living for was Sarah McLachlan, over and over and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
over, everywhere I went. I was driving my management crazy 'cause I would be like, "Come on, D, we

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
gotta go on the road. Oh, you gotta put this in."  They would go,"No." I said, "Then I ain't going!" And they would be like,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I said, "Then I ain't going." And they would be like 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
in for you." And they're like "There's something the matter with you. What's up with this? You're listening to Sara McLachlan," whatever whatever whatever.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So for one year I'm listenin' to Sarah McLachlan. At the end of the year my manager goes,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
"Yo, D, I got tickets to Clive Davis' Grammy party." Y'all know who Clive Davis is, right? If you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
win "American Idol," you get a deal with Clive Davis; he discovered Janis Joplin and all these people.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
But I'm like

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I have no time for Clive Davis and Hollywood. Because

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I have my Sarah McLachlan. That's all I care about."

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So he's like "Yo, D, man, I went through a hard time to get these tickets," the blah blah blah.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm looking and OK, I say, "OK. I'll go to the party, but I'm only stayin'

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
one...hour.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So I go to the party, Clive Davis Grammy part in L.A.. I'm- man, I'm counting the seconds

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
59, 58... I'm looking around, and there's Stevie Wonder.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
??? Alicia Keys,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Alicia Keys...who cares about Alicia Keys... paparazzi and Pam Anderson and 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
all this stuff, right I'm in there hatin' on everything! So I'm sitting at

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
a party that I did not want to go to, because all I want to do is listen to my

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Sarah McLachlan music. But guess who walks in?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[gasp!]

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
That lady! She was "that lady" to me. She was "that lady" to me then. That lady

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that made that record that changed my life. I'm losing it because nobody in the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
whole facility knows I'm an in-the-closet Sarah

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
McLachlan fan! But I'm losing it! I'm like

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"oh my, that's that lady." So I get myself together, I say "OK, I gotta go over there. If I

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
do die, kill myself, whatever, I gotta go over there and let her know what her record did for me."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So I walk over to Sarah McLachlan I'm in the the whole Run D.M.C. garb, the hat, the black all the way down.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
She sees me comin', she goes, "D.-D.M.C.! 'It's tricky

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to rock around, rock around,' and 'My Adidas!' and 'Walk This Way!'"

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm like "Wow." But in my head.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
This is where I was at. In my head I'm like

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
"That's a good reason to stay alive. Because Sarah McLachlan likes my music"

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
music. That's where I was at, y'all.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I go over to her and I say 'Hey, Miss McLachlan,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I just want to tell you, your record 'Angel,' your record 'Angel' saved my life. I was depressed, I was suicidal,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
but every day I listened to that record, I don't leave the house without listening to that record, it's the crutch I stand on. It's

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's like I...I...nev..nev...everything I do revolves around that record. And listen, the record is called Angel, you sing like 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
like a angel, people say you are an angel, but you you're not an angel to me, you're God." And I'm going on and on and on,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and she's looking at me like

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
"O...K...???"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Where is this coming from? I just wanted to say hi to his ass."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So I finish my little rap. She looks at me and she goes... she didn't know what to say. "Thank you

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Darryl. Because that's what music is supposed to do." Three whole years go by. She

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
by -- she shakes my hand, walks away -- three whole years

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
go by. I'm trying to figure out what this void in me, this and that, why do I want to kill myself.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But I ain't gonna kill myself, 'cause I got my Sarah MacLachlan music, I'm listening to Sarah McLachlan and figuring out why am I crazy. Listen, I'm going through a lot

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
of emotions!

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Then I realize something. People know my musical legacy.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What Run-D.M.C. did. First to go gold, first to go platinum, first on MTV

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
first with a record deal, first- of- all our firsts, but nobody knows the the legacy. Nobody knows

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
about the little boy Darryl who became D.M.C. so I said, "If I die,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
my friends and my fans, and people that I grew up with, my generation,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
they just know who D.M.C. what D.M.C did. They don't know about Darryl. And especially the younger generation"

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 the younger generation. So I said, "I gotta write a book." So I'm gonna write a book, and it's going to be "Yo, What's Up!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
my name is D.M.C. you know me Darryl McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., first to go gold first to go platinum, first on MTV

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
MTV, first on Rolling Stone, all the firsts..." I got to the point where, I got to, I wanted to write "Yeah,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I was born May 31st, 1964..."

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
When I got to that point, I realized that's all I know about the day I was born. So I said.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
"I gotta figure out,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
you know, the details of my birth. So I called my mother up: "Hey, Ma.""Hey, Darryl. How you doing?" "Love you.""Love you too. Did

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
you eat?""Yeah, Mom.""You're losing too much weight!""No, Mom, I'm

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
working out! It's a difference! But whatever, whatever. I just need to know three things, 'cause I'm writing this book. How

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
much did I weigh, what time was I born, and what hospital?" She told me those three things. "Love you."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"Love you too." Hung up the phone, boom. About an hour, later the phone rings. It's my mother my and my father.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
father. "Hey!""Hey, son, how you doing?" "What's up, Dad, yo, what's up?" "We

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
What's up dad, yo what's up? Hey we got something else to tell you. Blah-se-blah this, blah-se-blah that, blah blah blah. You was a month old

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
we think you're Dominican, and you're adopted

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you're adopted. You're adopted. You're adopted. You're adopted. You're adopted. You're adopted.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Right then and there, the whole world stopped. "ERRRRT"

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Thought about all the Run-D.M.C. stuff, St John's University High School when I was a little kid. And I thought about all that

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
stuff that I was laying in a, in a bed three years- or I mean couple of years earlier saying "Am I here just to be D.M.C?"

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Summed up everything about me. That was the one void, the piece of

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the missing link

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that had me going out of my mind, suicidal, because that was the one thing I didn't know about myself.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Now. If you think there's really a time to commit suicide, finding out you're adopted

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
at age 35, and people

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and people say, "D, they told you OVER THE PHOOOONE?!"

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But right then and there, something happened.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I remember it. Agh. When I asked myself in my head, ?did? D.M.C., and summed it up

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
That was the missing void, so the void was filled. I REALLY wanted to kill myself, but then I remembered

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
something.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Sarah McLachlan said that's what music is supposed to do, so I said "OK. Before I get

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
suicidal, depressed, and do something real crazy, she said that's what music is supposed to do."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I said I need to write a record that's gonna help that little orphan, or that little kid in

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
foster care who thinks 'They threw me away, I'm worthless. I mean nothing. My mother and father...love you..

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Because I may be D.M.C.. But what I really represent is purpose and destiny. So I need to make

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to make a record that's gonna inspire somebody the way Sarah McLachlan inspired me.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And I got a bigger idea! [gasp] I'mma call that lady back up.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Have that lady make that record with me." So, get Sarah MacLachlan on the phone and I'm thinking,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
"If she thought I was crazy three years ago. She gonna really think I'm crazy now!"

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
now." "Hey, Miss McLachlan, it's Darryl, remember me?""How could I forget you, Darryl:

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
you called me God. What do you want?"

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
want?" Okay, here we go. "Remember when I met you three years ago and I told you what your record did for me?""Yeah." "And then

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you looked at me and you told me that's what music's supposed to do.""Yeah." "Well, I ju- I found out why I was so depressed and suicidal, blah-se-blah this,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Blah-si-blah, well, my father told me I'm adopted, I need to make a record that's gonna inspire me the way, um, inspire people the

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the way your record inspired me, blah-se-blah, but I, will you help me do this record?"

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
"She goes "yes", real quick. I was like, "Wow, that was easy."

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I'm losing it now! I'm like "She said yes!" This and that, "I'll fly you to New York, put you in the Four Seasons,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
studio..." She says "No, Darryl. You can come to my house and make the record."

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Now I'm a fan, now, after four years of listening to this lady, I'm a fan, now, right? To make

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
a long story short, when she said "Come to my house," I fainted.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I woke up, I was in Vancouver, Canada. It's beautiful

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
there!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
At Sarah McLachlan's house, the lady whose record saved my life, right?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now listen, we went there, I said "Miss, McLachlan. I want to make a remake of Harry

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
of Harry Chapin's 'Cat's in the Cradle,' and I'm-a put my adoption story there, and I'm-a

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
give it a happy ending." "Okay, cool." Took us two days to make the record. Now

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
listen! It all started in a car with her record coming on the radio, right,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
A year goes by. I go to a party that I did not want to go to. Who walks in?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Then I find out that I was adopted. I call her up to do the record with me. So we did the record, right?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
All happy. I was all my way out the door, she says,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
"Darryl! Before you go I gotta tell you something!" Now...

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I love her to death, her music, everything, what she did for me: I'm in heaven!

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I'm on Cloud Nine! "Whatever it is you want, Miss McLachlan?"

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
She says, "Before you go, I need to tell you something, Darryl." And I say "What?" She says

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
"I was adopted, too."

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And I did not know that.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Everything happens for a reason.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Applause]

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
you.
