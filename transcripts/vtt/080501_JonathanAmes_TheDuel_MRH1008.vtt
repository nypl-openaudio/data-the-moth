00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
[Applause] Okay,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Well I'm gonna tell you my story now. In 1984 I was a sophomore

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
at Princeton and I was one of the captains on the fencing team.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I briefly want to explain fencing to you a little bit. For everyone. There are a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
few Jews knew what a Mohel was and certainly the male Jews remember what a Mohel was but for those of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
don't know what fencing is I'm going to give you a quick lesson. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
lesson. In fencing there are 3 weapons and I'm going to-, um I'm not going to make a joke about

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a pen being mightier than the sword but I'm going to use

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
a pen as a sword tonight which is only fitting since it's the PEN festival. But. So, 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
quickly fencing there are 3 weapons: the most common weapon that people know about is the foil.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And then foil, the torso is the target area. And you use the tip of the blade. Like that,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and so just the torso, not the arms, only the torso. Another weapon is the épée

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and in that. With that weapon. The whole body is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the target including the feet, the legs, the head, everything. But again, you only use the point.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now the weapon I fenced was saber. And it was, for me, the most dashing, the most romantic, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the most Errol Flynn-like, because the way you scored touches were was

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a slashing motion oftentimes I have a real saber when I do this and you would have been in peril. But because I'm

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
an expert I merely would have just snipped a hair for a moment but very lovely right in the front here. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Anyway, so the saber is a slashing weapon and the whole, and the whole

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
target area is everything above the hips. Including the head and the arms. And so you make

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
cutting motions like that, and you slash across the body. And it's very dynamic. So I was

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the captain and I loved the romance of fencing. So I named all my fellow

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Saber fencers after great swordsmen in history.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
There was Sir Gawain, the Green Knight, one sort of goofy freshman we called Don Quixote. And

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
myself I named El Cid. I was a Charlton Heston fan. This was, um, you know I

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
loved his face. This was before he was wearing that horrible wig and,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you know, became an NRA spokesman, but even that was OK. He had a great face, you don't see faces

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
like that every day, so I called myself El Cid after the great Charlton Heston role. Now

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now I had a secret goal that sophomore year at

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Princeton. And while training and that was to beat the number one saber fencer at Columbia.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Russell Wilson. My lifetime record against Russell Wilson was about 0 in 13.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'd been fencing him all through high school. I'd been fencing him at Junior Olympics. He

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
was always beating me. Once at a party at the Junior Olympics he snubbed me

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
socially, which only added to my growing wound.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
He trained in New York City with like, expatriate Russian coaches, he had incredible

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
skill. He was snobby, I, he- he was also a lot a little bit chubby. And he had these 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
sophisticated moves so his whole world view was opposed to mine and. And I was always losing to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
him. So my goal, my secret goal sophomore year was to beat Russell Wilson.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now to get ready for this I would go for early morning lessons with my French fencing coach

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
at Princeton. Who

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
was a gorgeous man he had a. He had a bald head. Not that that's gorgeous, but he had a bald head 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And beautiful gray eyes kind of look like Sean Connery. He'd been a commando in the in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the Algerian war, the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the French Algerian war. And he would train me early in the morning coming at me with a steel rod

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to make my parries extra firm 'cause "you block here, you block here. You block here for the head". And

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
he'd come at me "El Cid, come on El Cid, commando, commando!". Because he was big into being a commando and he

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
was seeing me as a possible commando and he would come at me with a steel bar going "commando, commando!".

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And I would get ready and he would tell me to be in my own guard position which is like this:"you must have a b- a band of 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
steel in the groin El Cid". I don't know why we had to have a band of steel down here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but wasn't chaste or anything like that but liked us to have a band of steel down here. Come at me with

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this rod. Then afterwards you know he would tell me stories with the war and he would often tell this one

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
story. He goes, "One time, El Cid, I was walking along on patrol and suddenly an electric cable

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
shot me in the buttocks and I went flying in the air 30, 40 feet. I was flying through the air, but then I landed on my

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
feet like a cat! Like a cat, El Cid! That's how you have to be with balance when you fence, El Cid". It was- and then

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
2 days later he'd be like. "El Cid, one time I was on patrol and electric cables struck me in the buttocks and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I went flying through the air and then I landed on my feet like a cat! That's how you have to be" and I don't know, he was on some 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
loop

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
'cause every 2 or 3 days I would hear this electric cables story, in the bottocks and flying through the air

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and I'd be like "Yes coach, you're the greatest" you know, he had a huge ego he would claim that when he was my age

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
he could fly when he went out as someone with his saber you know, 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
he goes "I became ?plainar?". You know this was ?plainar? like he would be totally flying through the air

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
with his saber and. Well, somehow at the time I sort of believed him, you know, he said it with

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
such conviction. Anyway so. We're both training like crazy. Finally the big

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
meet against Columbia happened, and we took a van from Princeton up to Columbia. And

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the coach also wanted me to win terribly because his wife had left him and was shacking

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
up with the Columbia's coach, he had a thing for swordsman

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I guess and so she - he really wanted me to win, we both had a vendetta. So we go up to 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Columbia,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and we're in the gym getting ready, and the Columbia team's not around, we're in our white

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
outfit, stretching, starting to work out a little bit.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And then suddenly the whole gym fills with Wagner music. The r- "The ride of the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Valkyries"right? This scary Wagner music and for me, I'm Jewish and I'm like "What is this,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Wagner?" you know this is Rocky music for the Nazi party this is horrible [laughter]

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and then suddenly the Columbia team comes racing in with their white outfits and their

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
swords trying to intimidate us to this Wagner, like the Nazi party. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And it only made me more ?incense?, made me want to beat Russell Wilson even more.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So anyway, before I got to fence Russell Wilson though I fenced a lesser, the lesser saber guy on the 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Columbia team and I LOST to him, I was so keyed on Russell Wilson I lost, which was disastrous.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But our team was still competing, so then finally I got to fence Russell Wilson.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
This bout I'd been training months for these, you know, commando lessons with the iron rod in the morning

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the, you know, the buttock story, all so I could beat Russell Wilson. I get down in my band

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of steel, we're moving back and forth, I think to his head and I cut him across the belly, and I go up 1-0

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Now, to win a fencing bout you have to score five touches. And so I was - I had gotten

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the first one and when I scored a touch in fencing I would... The language of fencing is French, and

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
so when I scored the touch I went "et là!", and "et là" means "and there", like: and there you swine,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
you fool, you idiot, you know, you- you, you Londoner or something like that. So I, you know

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
"Et là!". And I, I said it really loud right? And then we're moving back and forth, he tried to come here, boom! I

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
hit him right in the head, I'm up 2-0.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
This is incredible, I'm winning, it's beautiful! That he got a touch 2-1. But then I went

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
ahead 3-1, this was wonderful. But then he started coming back: 3-2, 3-3,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
it's like Oh doh! You know I got down my band of steel and I went ahead 4-3.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But then sure enough he got, you know, he fainted to my head, cut me across the belly: it was now tie

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
4-4. I could sense it going out of my hands, my inner loser was asserting

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
[laughter] You know, my whole Oedipal upbringing, my father was always trying to crush me to keep me

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
out of my mother's bed and everything like that. And so I could just sense it was happening again, oh no, I'm going

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
to lose it was 4-4.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Now, when it's 4-4 in fencing it's called "La Belle", the beautiful touch, because it's

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
like the touch right before death.You know the French love the death: le petite mort, le grand mort, they love it all

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
yea, and so, So 4-4 is La Belle, because if you're recreating a duel to the death

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
the next touch would be the death touch.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So my coach calls timeout. I lift up my mask. And he starts speaking to me in French

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
"il va faire le contre-temps"and- and at this point I'm not absorbing any French I've been saying "et là"

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
with every touch. "et là!" you know

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I couldn't get- that was the only French I could get out of me, or in me. But he's giving me all these

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
instructions with French and I'm going "OK coach". But I sense I'm going to lose and... so he walked

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
off, my mask came down. And then he turned and looked at me with these beautiful bullet grey eyes

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.000
he had

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and he said: "Commando". And that was like our secret communication [laughter]

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Commando! The iron rod, everything. OK I've g- so I got down in my band of steel

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and I decided to do something very risky.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I was going to - I'd try to win by playing it defensive, because I knew Russell Wilson he wanted

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to really humiliate me and one way to humiliate a saber fence or, the hand would also be target

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
area

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And in fencing you're supposed to keep your hand back. But to keep your balance sometimes you would come forward and even

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
though it's sort of macho and Errol Flynn like, it does look a little ?flip Fayez? as you're kind of moving forward with this

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
hand

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
kind of very genteel and you know, the pinky up or something like that, but anyway: my hand

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
was out and I knew he was going to want to cut it. To really defeat me terribly. So I kind of kept it

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
out there almost like a choke fisherman with a lure.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Come on Russell Wilson, go over my hand, try to humiliate me, I know you're a sadist

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you snubbed me at that party in Cleveland. Come on, cut my head! So I was leaving

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
it dangling out there, right? now the danger was um, when I went to parry if I went too

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
far, if I overcompensated, he would quickly move and cut me here. That was the danger of going

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.000
for that. So-

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
but I leave it out there, I'm leaving it out there, I'm drawing him in, he's moving back and forth, it's a beautiful dance, fencing.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And then suddenly sure enough,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
he makes his move he goes from my hand. I wait till last I can...boom. I parry him

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
it was beautiful, it was delicious, it was a wonderful clang of steel

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I had him blocked. Now, and his head was right there because it extended him so. So all I had to do was

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
go like that, tap him right on the head. And I win. All I had to do is go and tap him right on the head.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Now in fencing, like everything in life, the closest distance between two points is a straight line. So just like that

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
play now! like the coach has been tel- telling me. But instead like an idiot, like an inner

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
loser, like blinded Oedipus I rear back leg that exposing my arm.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
You fool! I sense my foolishness. But Russell Wilson was so shocked that I parried and I still had time.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So I compensate and I came down ferociously on top of his head like that "Et là!" and

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I went so nuts, so much craziness, my whole life! So much confusion,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
All came out right on his head. And my saber

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
snapped and broke over his head, went flying into the air, [laughter] probably blinded

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
a ?coeditor? you know, Barnard, it went flying into the air, it was beautiful. And I went

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
like that, and I had scored the touch, but then I went nuts like I started going 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
"Et là! Et là! Et là! Et là! Et là! Et là! Et là!"

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It was like I had French Tourette, I was like a dog into the alleyway making love like the

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
greatest lover ever. Up and down, this pumping motion the Et là!s

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the whole place was going crazy and the judge was actually a Holocaust survivor. With one eye

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and a lump, and a bad leg. Somehow he'd seen this. Nobody could miss that I had broken the blade over his head.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And he goes "touch to the left to Ames, to Princeton". And I had won! whoever wins in life? No one,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that's why we're here tonight, you never win!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But I had won and I was lifted up by my teammates, the greatest fencing victory of my life.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I was ebullient and then I saw Russell Wilson

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
down below just kind of dizzy. And I said "oh, nice bout" completely disingenuous

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
but showing good form. And we shook hands and so that is the story of my greatest fencing

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
victory

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:55.000
[laughter, applause]

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Thank you

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
[applause] So, just 

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
2 little quick thing, almost like a coda. Um, several years later I was

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
at a dinner party. I mean a few years ago. At a dinner party and several years after the fact and I took

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
my knife and I told the story. And a girl at the dinner said "I know Russell Wilson, 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
he's an arms dealer now for the government" I was like "What?". Anyway. So then I was like

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
"Wow, well I defeated him, you know". And I don't care about him and going in helicopters over the Middle East

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
but, anyway. So then she emails me like a week later : "I mentioned you to Russell Wilson. He said

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
he didn't remember you"

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
[laughter] So, snatched it away from me! Anyway, thank

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:46.000
you

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:50.000
[applause]

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
thank.
