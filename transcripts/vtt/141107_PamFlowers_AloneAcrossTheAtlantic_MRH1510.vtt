00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you. Well, when I was a little girl, uh,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We had this radio in our house. This thing was as big as a piece of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
furniture. And I used to sit there on the floor with my

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
ear pressed up against the speaker and I would listen to my favorite

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
radio program. It was about this guy named Sergeant Preston and his dog, King, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And they used to have a dog team and they'd go running all over the Arctic righting wrongs and I used to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
fantasize about how one day I was going to grow up and I was going to do those very

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
things. But of course life kind of got in the way a little

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
bit. And believe it or not, forty

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
years later, there I was standing on the outskirts of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Barrow, Alaska. Alone with an eight-dog team and we were going

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to dog sled across Arctic America to the east side of Canada.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well I just didn't get up one day and say, "Well, I guess I'm going to dog sled across 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Acrtic America.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'd actually spent about ten years in Alaska. And I had learned how

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to dog sled, how to take care of my

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
dogs, and gone on a lot of expeditions to gain experience.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So when we left Barrow, Alaska on February 14, 1993,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I believed that my eight dogs and I were ready to go.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now the way it works in dog sledding is you have a team of dogs, in this case I had

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
eight, and you put a harness on them; and on the end of the harness there's a line; and

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the line goes back to the front of the sled; and the musher stands on the back of the sled; and you tell

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
those dogs what to do. So you don't have any leash or rein. You just

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
use your voice

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to control the dogs. Well of course it's kind of tricky to figure out how to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
make eight dogs do the same thing at the same time.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So you have what's called a "lead dog." And that's kind of, you know, the head dog, the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
number one lead dog.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
My dog was a dog named Douglas. And I called him Duggie Dog.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Duggie Dog was a big ole seventy five pound floppy-eared guy and he was

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
just happy go lucky. He'd do

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
anything I ask him to do. Duggie had a son

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
named Robert.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And as far as anyone knows,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Robert never did a single thing he was told in his entire

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
life. So why

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is he in the team? Well, the bitter truth is I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
didn't have much in the way of money, I needed eight dogs, I only had eight dogs, so if you're in my kennel,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You were going.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I took Robert along and I put him in the back of the team where I thought he couldn't cause any trouble

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and to be fair to Robert he did work pretty hard.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So off we went on our first day and our first day was absolutely spectacular. I mean,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
everything went just the way it was supposed to go. And I'm standing there in camp that first

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
night. And I'm looking around and look at my dogs all snuggled

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
up

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
behind the sleds, my little red and white tent is waiting for

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
me and I'm looking around and I'm thinking, "You know, we're pretty isolated.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
There's nobody else around us for a long ways." But that's OK

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
because you know I'm a person who really loves solitude and isolation.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And anyway I was so jazzed. I mean, my dream was coming

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
true! Well, I was going to be the first woman to dog sled across

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the Arctic. No woman had ever done this alone before. And I had spent a couple of years

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
looking

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
for sponsorship. And no one would help us. No one.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So I borrowed every nickel it took to make this happen.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And not too long before we left I ran into my neighbor, guy named

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Dave, I like to call him "Neighbor Dave."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And I told Neighbor Dave my woes about

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
money and Neighbor Dave, you know, he's this big guy. He's like 6' 4" and two hundred pounds and he

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
looks down at me and he

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
says, "Well what do you expect? You're five feet nothing,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
weigh a hundred pounds soaking wet, and those eight dogs

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of yours, are nothing but a bunch of clunkers.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Nobody believes in you and you're gonna fail."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Wow. Thanks, Dave.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So I'm standing there

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in that camp that first night and I thought to myself,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
"You cannot listen to people like Dave."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I thought, you know, these people they don't see what I see they don't feel what

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I feel when I'm up here. And I'm looking at the sun in the western sky. And I'm

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
looking at the Arctic Ocean and this giant sheet of ice. And all this land frozen. And I think

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
about the power it took to make that happen.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
My dogs and I have the same stuff in us, as what's in all of that.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And when I look at that,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I don't feel small, I don't feel weak. I feel full

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of power like I can do anything. Well, I wasn't naive

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
enough to think that this is going to be a day at the beach. This was gonna

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
be a pretty arduous

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
thing. As it turned out there were going to be, there were

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
more storms in the Arctic that winter than there had been in recorded

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
history. So when a storm is coming, you need to

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
stop

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
before it comes. And you set up your camp and I would put

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
my dog sleds on their sides and then put the dogs behind the sleds out of the wind,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
set up my tent, and I get in there and snuggle up with a

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
book and read. But it is not a time actually when

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
you can just rest because I would go out every four hours round the clock

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and check on my dogs. Make sure they had enough food. And if it was so windy

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I couldn't stand up,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I did that on my hands and knees. Well of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
course, it wasn't all bad weather. We had

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
just so many spectacular days out there, it's so beautiful in the Arctic.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
One day that stands out most in my mind is this one day right before we crossed

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the Canadian

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
border. And I'm looking off to the south and there are these mountains.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And it's just got a little snow on it, it looks like scrimshaw, and the Arctic Ocean,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and the air was

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
so pure it had no smell. And so quiet.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000
There's no sound. It's just. Total. Peace.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And we continued along, we're sledding. We came around to this

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
beautiful big beach.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And it looks so perfect, looked like a superhighway right in front of us and I got this

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
idea. I thought I'm going to take Robert. My dog, Robert.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I'm going to put him up in front beside my number one lead dog, Duggie Dog.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And I'm going to give Robert a chance to show that he can learn commands.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
What could he possibly do wrong?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
About five minutes later, we came around the corner and there up in a ravine off to the right

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
was a mother polar bear and cub.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
They're about a hundred yards away and they're standing on this

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
beautiful white snow and this perfect blue sky behind them - it's like a picture.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And I thought, "You know, the dogs aren't even going to see her."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Well, Robert's a bit of a tourist.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And he just happens to look off to the right and he saw the bears. And so now he swings to the right

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and he wants to go and visit the bears.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Now I'm sure that Robert thought those bears were dogs

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
because dogs really don't like bears. And I'm yelling at  Duggie, "Haw!" That means go left. "Haw, Duggie, haw!"

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Because I'm trying to get Duggue to take us away from the bears. But now the other six dogs see

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
what Robert is seeing and they decide they need to go see the bears.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So now the whole team swung hard to the right and we are rocketing 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
across this frozen beach. I'm standing on the brake as hard as

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I can but it's not working because there's only about an inch of snow on this beach. And there's

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
nothing for it to bite into. I'm trying to flip the sled over but I can't flip it over.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We are rocketing the across this beach; we get to the bottom of the ravine. Now the

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
ravine is full of hard packed wind blown snow. And

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the brake bites and we jerk to a halt.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But now my lead dogs Duggie and

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Robert are only about three feet from this

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
bear. And I'm like maybe sixty feet.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And I'm yelling at Duggie "Haw, haw." Go to the left. But he doesn't hear me it's just

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
total chaos. I have no control over anything that's happening. And this bear is

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
standing there looking at us and she is not happy.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And she looked at my dog Duggie. And

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
she ran towards him in kind of a false charge. She tried to stop before she

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
hit him. But actually the ravine was so slick that she

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
banged right into him and sent him tumbling to the bottom of the ravine taking the whole team with him.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
She turned around and high tailed it back to her cub and when the dogs saw her running away,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
they tried to chase after her but they couldn't quite get to her because of course the break is still

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.000
in

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the snow.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And now this bear is getting really agitated, and the dogs are lunging and lunging and barking.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And she's getting more and more agitated and she starts to

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
drool. You would have to be there to see how much drool can come out of

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
an agitated bear's mouth.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Now.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
This is like four water faucets going off at one

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
time. And then she starts wagging her

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
head and clawing at the snow.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And then she made this sound. "Haaa"

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I'd always been told by native people, when a polar bear makes that sound,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they're getting serious. And you better be ready.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Amazingly I just got real

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
calm and everything around me started happening in slow motion.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I reached into my sled bag. And I pulled out my shotgun.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Turn off the safety. And I aimed it at her.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And I thought if she's going to hurt one of my dogs,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I'm going to shoot her.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
then everything stopped. It just got totally silent. No

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
more barking. No more

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
hissing. Just silence.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And then the bear seemed to see me for the first time. She took one

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
step towards me and she looked at me with those coal black eyes.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Ah...my stomach just lurched.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And I stepped away from the sled. One step. And I held out my hand and I

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
said, "It's OK, It's OK, We're going to go now."

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And I swear I heard that bear say to me in my mind:

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
"I don't want to hurt you I just want you to go." And with that. She

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
just walked to her den opening about seventy feet away and slipped inside.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And her little cub is running over there trying to catch up to

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
mama. And it got right beside the den opening, now it had had its

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
first lesson on how to be a big tough polar bear. And

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
it looked over at us and it went, "ha!"

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
[laughing]

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And then it jumps inside and I never saw them again.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So I ran up, got the lines untangled and jumped on the sled and I said, "All

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
right. Let's go." I wanted as much distance between us and those polar bears as possible.  We didn't

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
stop for three

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
hours. And it took me three days

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
to stop shaking. We had many more

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
challenges on this journey. But somehow we always managed to rescue

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
one another. This journey took eleven

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
months. And then, my eight dogs and I went home happy

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and healthy. I had wanted to prove,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by doing this journey, that my dogs and I were good enough.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So we weren't a bunch of clunkers. And together we did that.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But what I gained most was a profound respect for my dogs.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And for myself.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And as for Neighbor

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Dave. Ah, who cares what Dave thinks.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Thank

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
you.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
