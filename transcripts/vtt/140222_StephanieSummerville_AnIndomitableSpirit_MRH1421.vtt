00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, I grew up in southern Indiana in the late nineteen-sixties to overprotective parents.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to overprotective parents. We were a barely middle class family living in a not

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a not so great neighborhood. But my parents wanted the best for me and better than what was in the world around me, so

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
around me.  So, to that end I lead a very sheltered life.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
life. I only went to home school and church. Uh, at the age of five I began piano lessons

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
began piano lessons, I could go there. But I could not play with any of the kids in my neighborhood I could only play in the backyard

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
play in the backyard with my little sister.  Now my

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now my mother was a beautiful and elegant woman.  She was a bit of a fashionista.  She was the kind of lady that would

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of lady that would get dressed up to go to the mailbox.  And she dressed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And she dressed in the style of Jackie O.  Now, my father was an incredible

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
an incredible, charismatic person. He had an upbeat attitude, and a can-do kind of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
do kind of spirit.  And he dressed, and moved, and looked like Sidney Poitier

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Poitier, and I was the center of his universe as he was mine.  When I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When I was a little girl as a toddler, I would, he would dress me up, and go, and I'd go with him on errand day and he would

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
he would be obnoxious with a camera.  He would get total strangers to take

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to take pictures of us together.  And then he would regale them with tales of my brilliance as a three-year-old

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
three-year-old.  So, when I got a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
when I got a little older I was about eight-years-old. I became more of a, uh,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a, uh, the son that my father never had.  And I spent a lot of time in his study, and we had

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and we had one of those studies like you saw in the movies.  He had a floor to ceiling bookcase with the entire

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
entire Encyclopedia Britannica.  And he had a big, oak desk with clawed feet,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and I used to sit in his lap. And he would teach me how to write with a fountain pen.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
My father had the belief

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that one of the things that you needed to make your way in the world was

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
a distinctive and impressive signature. So he taught me how to copy his

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
his signature with a fountain pen and how to create one of my own, a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
unique signature of my own.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that's one of the best shared moments that I have. With my father. That. And the 1976

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Summer Olympics. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Olympics. Because first of all it was our first world event together, and for the first

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
time in Olympic history something had happened that it never happened before. An athlete was

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
awarded a score of a perfect ten, and it was given to Nadia Comaneci at the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
age of sixteen for her impressive and flawless gymnastics routine.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And my father explained to me how difficult that was because

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the athletes were rated on two different scales. They got a rating for artistic impression

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and one for technical merit,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and those were averaged out together to get a perfect score so she had to get a ten

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
on both, both ratings, in order to come up with a perfect 10 for a final score.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And when I learned this I became obsessed with the Olympic rating

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
scale. I began reading everything in my life on the rating scale. My

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
dad's pancake flipping, his left hand turns into the driveway, my scales and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
arpeggios I could play.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This thing took over my life. So in 1979 I turned 13,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and two very important things happened.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
First of all I got a summer job, and, two, I began to notice

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
boys. Now this summer job was an early work program because my parents were, like, overachievers,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and they wanted me to get started on my job experience and character references. So it was

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
about me and about 19 other 13 year olds. It was about a mix of ten boys, ten girls.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And our job was to detastle corn. Which

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I'm sure you all know in Iowa. [groans and laughter] Thank you.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Hellacious, hellacious, job, OK,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
in the burning hot sun and, like, you know, high mud

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and so like. After the first week of this most of the girls cut out, so it was only, like, me

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and one other girl by the end of the week. So I instantly became the center of attention.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And the person, one person who became the center of my attention was

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Robert Buster Townsend

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the 3rd. And

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Buster, Buster was delicious.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He was. He was a fair skin, freckle-faced black boy

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and he had an athletic build. And he was not the brightest bulb on the tree,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but I did not care because he could have read a grocery list, and I was mesmerized.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So, about a week of,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
like, fishing around with each other and flirting we finally decided that we liked each

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
other and that's when Buster first made the attempt to kiss me.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Now, I have not had the birds and the bees speech with my parents yet,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and the only things I knew about sex I had gleaned from the Harlequin romance novels

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that my spinster cousin had left over at my grandma's

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
house. And so the things that I got out of them were this. Was first

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of all that all intimate relationships began with a kiss and,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
according to the writing, all of these women who got this kiss were somehow

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
forever changed.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Like the, the writing would get all flowery, a-and you

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
wouldn't know what was going on but that's only thing you could figure out. So the only thing that I could

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
parallel this with, the only other stories like a parallel this with, in my own life, that I knew about, were

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Dr. Jekyll and Mr.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Hyde and Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Those are the only stories I knew where

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
people started out one way and something happened and they were forever changed. So

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I figured that if I started to, if I had Buster kiss me, then something I was going

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
to transform in some way that I could not control, so I wouldn't let him kiss me. So

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
we went through this whole process

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
where we would you know after work we'd hang out in a parking lot and hold hands and flirt. And he'd try to kiss me and, you know, 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I wouldn't let him kiss me.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So one day we're holding hands and my father pulls up in the parking lot kind of

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
early, so I go skipping off and I get in the car, and I immediately noticed that

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
my dad is really angry and really silent. I could tell something

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
is going on, because he's staring straight out the windshield and he's not looking at me

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and he's gripping the steering wheel. And so I look over kind of nervous and I say,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
"Dad, is there something wrong?" And my dad erupts into

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
what sounds to me like

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
this loud long lion roar of a

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
monologue, "I SAW YOU TALKING TO THESE BOYS.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I SAW YOU HOLDING HANDS WITH THESE BOYS." And

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
he pulls out like these big SAT words "Boys are like licentious

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and nefarious CREATURES." And so now,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I am both terrified

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and amazed. So he doesn't speak to me

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
for the rest of, you know, the rest of the evening. And so we get back in the car, and he's taken me to work the

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
next day, and he's giving me a less vocal rendition of the licentious and

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
nefarious speech, but

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
instead of me, you know, being frightened, I'm starting to get angry. And I'm

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
getting more and more angry to the point where I'm-- by the time we get there, I'm kind of pissed off.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So I look at him when I get out of the car, and I slam the car door. And I turn around, and I,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that's when I made the decision that, I am going to let Buster kiss me, come what may.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I didn't care, didn't care.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So now here it is, after work,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and I'm standing in the parking lot, and I let Buster kiss me.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And can I tell you, it was the most amazing thing. It was delicious, okay?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
When our lips met. It was like somewhere in

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
my mind. A door swung open to a room full

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
of incredible sensations, And that room, I realized

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
was called pleasure.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it was like a medium-long kiss, but

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
when it was over, Busters parents were there, and so h-he, kind of, you know,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
disappeared. And I'm standing there basking in the glow of this kiss, and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I realize that this is a very monumental moment in my life.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
One that needs to be rated. So I quickly, [laughter] 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It does, it does! So I immediately start to rate this kiss, I'm considering its artisitic

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
impression and the technical merit. So

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I decided, I did, I decided

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to give Buster a 9.7 for technical

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
merit, and an 8.8 for artistic impression for combined score of about

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
9.3. Which I thought was good because it left room for improvement, but it was a

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
pretty good kiss.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[laughter and applause]

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I had settled all of that in my mind, and then I looked up

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and realized that I was the only kid left in the parking lot. So I

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
just started the walk home because that's what you did in the 1970s, we didn't have cell phones you can let your

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
kids just kind of wander

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
home. So now, I'm walking home, and I'm thinking

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
about the consequences of this kiss because now I'm going to be forever changed.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So I'm checking myself to see if there's any kind of transformation is going to take place, and

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I'm developing contingency plans in my head in case my behavior changes and

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I can't control it. So, this is where my head is that, and finally when I get to

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the door of

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
my house, before I can barely even knock on the door, my mother opens the door and she says, "I

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
need you to help me with your father."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And so I go into the living room, and I look at my father is lying in the fetal

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
position on the couch, and he's shaking

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
violently. And we had to take him to the hospital.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So we get him, um, registered in emergency, and it takes about an hour and a

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
half and we filled out paperwork

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And my father comes back and he's lying stretched out on a gurney, and he's not quite shaking as much,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but he's in a hospital gown, and, I look at him, and his eyes are

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
very wide they kind of remind me of the look that the bunny rabbits

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
have that graze in our backyard. And it was the first time that I saw my

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
father looking so frail, and I said, "Dad are you alright?"

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And with that classic smile and that can-do spirit he didn't say anything but he sort of

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
just smiled and nodded.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And as they wheeled him away on the gurney my father's

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
downward spiral begins as he spends thirty days in I.C.U. in

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
a coma and finally

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
dies. And

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
that's when my world began to implode, because from that day,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I never went back to that job. I never saw Buster again.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And I never had time to process any of

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
this, because I was too busy trying to share her household responsibilities with my mother

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
while trying to keep up with the expectations of my

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
father. And it doesn't even really hit me until one day, I'm 29 years

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
old, and I'm on my lunch break and I'm standing in an open air

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
parking garage. And the smell of corn comes wafting in

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
over the whole Ohio River and it comes back to me and I start to

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
cry. Because I remember that the last real

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
interaction that I had with my father was when I slammed the car

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
door. And it didn't make me feel very good, I started to feel very guilty.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But then

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the corn also brought back, the small the corn brought back, the memory of

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that delicious kiss.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
kiss.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
9.7 for technical merit. And

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
8.8 for artistic impression. And

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
even kisses today have a

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
very complex emotional feeling that it brings up inside of me

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of nostalgia and guilt and pleasure. And it

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
took me a very, very long time, but later what I realized

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
was this.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
this. Is that no kiss in the world could ever

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
taint or destroy my father's love for me or his legacy

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that lives in me of his indomitable

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
spirit, his can-do attitude, and his kick-

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
ass signature. Thank you.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Thank you. You'll.
