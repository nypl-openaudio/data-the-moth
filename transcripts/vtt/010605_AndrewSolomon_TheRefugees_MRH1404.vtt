00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Which is that while I was working on my book on depression, I became really

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
interested in the idea that depression is a universal phenomenon. And most of

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the people I was talking to about depression,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
were essentially middle class Western people who had been through nervous breakdowns

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of one kind or another.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so I went into all of these different contexts to look at how depression functioned among really

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
poor people and among people across history. And

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I went into a lot of non-Western contexts and looked at depression among the Greenlandic

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Inuit and depression among tribes people in Senegal and talked

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to some people from Rwanda about what they'd been

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
through and I had a really amazing set of experiences in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Cambodia which was actually the first place that I went in the course of this broadening set of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
examinations

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
examinations. And I went there because I wanted to see what happens in a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
country where the entire population has been subjected

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to enormous trauma. What is it like when it's not just a person who's had a little private

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
trauma and who says, "Well, everyone else is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
OK, look what happened to me." But rather a whole country that has just been completely

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
devastated. And, so I went to see what life

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was like among survivors of the Khmer Rouge.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And when I got Cambodia, I talked to various people

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and eventually someone gave me the name of a woman who they said had done some amazing work with

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
depressed survivors of the Khmer Rouge and gave me her phone number. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I called her up and we spoke on the phone, and she didn't speak English very well

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and I had someone

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
kind of help me out who spoke Cambodian. But we made an arrangement to meet each other 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and she set the location. It was a room upstairs from a newspaper office, 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
sort of in the outskirts of Phnom Penh. And I said I'd bring a 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
translator. And I got there and there was this tiny, 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
kind of four-foot-tall 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
woman with her hair sort of pulled back and with a kind of, already before we started

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
talking, sort of intense expression and this kind of slightly flickering 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
quality that I'd noticed in a lot of the people who had been through Khmer Rouge

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
stuff, looking around. And we started talking and I said,"Why don't we

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
just try to talk to each other and not have a translator." I said, "So now, let's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
begin with what, what happened to 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you during the Khmer Rouge period." And she said, "Well, I didn't have such 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
a bad time." And so then she told me about "not such a bad time," which I thought was kind of a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
bad time. Um, she said that she had worked as 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a secretary in the Ministry of Finance and that when 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Pol Pot came into power, she had managed, unlike most people who were so-called intellectuals, 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to pretend to be 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
a peasant; and so she had not been summarily 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
executed immediately. She had been separated

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
from her husband and she was with her three children. She had a daughter who was twelve,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a son who was six and an infant. And she and her three children 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
were taken together off to a 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
reeducation camp. And on the way out to the reeducation camp. She was tied

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to a tree and made to watch while a battalion of soldiers 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
raped and then murdered her daughter. She was then let free, 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and she went on with her six-year-old son 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and the infant and she got to the reeducation camp in the country. And they were set to work 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
tilling in the fields. And she spent some time tilling in the fields, and she 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
said that was OK. She was there for a few months. And then one day she was told that 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
somebody had reported something on her and she and her 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
two children were taken to the killing fields. And very few people who are

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
taken to those fields ever left them. When she got there she was tied to a bamboo stake

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that was positioned over a kind of low ravine 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in such a way that as long as she kept her knees braced, she could stand up. But

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
as soon as she really released them or fell asleep, she would

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
tumble over into the ravine and die at the bottom of the ravine. And her 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
two children were tied on to her, and she stood there 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
with her two children, and the children were screaming. And she finally said to one of the soldiers... 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
she said she was trying to think of something to say.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 She remembered the name of somebody who was kind of middle management in the Khmer Rouge. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And she said, "Listen," she said, "you know, I was actually for a long time 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the mistress of this guy." She said, 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
"And I think if you kill me you're gonna find out you're gonna get in a lot of trouble." She said, 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"I just don't think you really want to be killing me." She said, "Reeducating me is fine, but if you're the one who kills 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
me he's going to find out and it's not gonna be good for you." So 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
this guy said, "I'm not sure I believe you but on the chance that you're right, 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm going to cut your ... the things that are tying you and I'm gonna let you go. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And you go into the jungle, which starts right over there, and you get down there and don't you ever let me  

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
see you again because if 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I or anyone else sees you...any time, that will be the end for you." 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And he cut the ropes that were tying her up, and she grabbed her two children 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and they ran into the jungle. And they got into the jungle and they lived in the jungle 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
on roots and on

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
whatever they could get from the trees that were in the jungle. And she said she just kept running. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
She said she tried 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
never to see another human being because 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
she never knew, if she saw even 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the rustle of movement in the distance, who was on which side. After a while, 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because she had such poor nutrition living this way, the milk in her breasts dried up, and so

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
her infant died. So she was left with just the six-year-old, but she managed to live with him in that way 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
in the jungle for more than two years until the fall of Pol Pot. And finally after 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
two years, Pol Pot fell and she was able to come back out of the jungle.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
She came back out with this child and she made her way back to Phnom Penh. 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And when she got there she was wandering around in the desolation with lots of other people who were 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
similarly ... had returned 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to Phnom Penh and she managed to find her husband who had also not been killed because he had, 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
very early on, been beaten so badly about the head with heavy objects that he 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
had become a functional idiot and he had been left as 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a sort of street person wandering around outside of the city because the city had been emptied out. 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But she'd found him, and she and he and their son were taken and they were put into a resettlement 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
camp on the border of Thailand. And when they got to that resettlement camp, she was 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
one of 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the few people there who was actually educated because almost all educated people had been found and killed. 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And because she was educated she actually spoke foreign 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
languages. And so she was able to communicate with the foreign aid workers who had come 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to work in the resettlement camp. And she began talking to them. 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And she was given a nicer hut than most of the people who were in tents in that camp were 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
given. And she lived in that hut and she began looking at the other people in the camp. 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And she saw that there were all of these poor women who had 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
made it through the whole Khmer Rouge period and who were living in tents, and who weren't taking 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
care of their own children; who were just lying there, in these tents 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
completely still, completely vacant, and letting their own 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
children wander around unfed and uncared for. And she went to the foreign aid 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
workers and she said, "We have to do something for these people." She said at that point she didn't really 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
have the word for depression but she said, "There's something wrong with these women. They're not doing anything. 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
They're hardly even alive." Well, some of the foreign aid workers actually 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
tried to get some antidepressant medication, but those were still 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
relatively early days for antidepressants, 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and there wasn't really 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
very much that could be done, and finances were very tight. And so she said, 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
"I want to try to 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
do something for these women." And she began going around and trying to 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
stir them up. And she said over the next couple of 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
years, she began to put together a program. And as she'd been describing 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
all of this, we were sitting in this sort of small room, and telling her own story she remained very composed. 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But when she started to talk about these other women, she 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
fell off the little sofa she'd been sitting on, and she began to weep. She said, "They 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
were just sitting there, and I went to them, and I finally understood that I could 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
help them by working with them in three stages. 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I had to teach them three things. The first thing," she said, "was that I had to teach 

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
them to forget." She said, "Their minds were so full of the horrible things that had happened to them, 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and such horrible things had happened to them. And first 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I had to get them to tell me what those horrible things were. And then I had to talk to them and give 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
them some other things to think about and some other things to put in their minds. Because they 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
would never forget completely the horrible things that had happened to them, but I needed to crowd out 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a little bit the bad stuff that was taking up every 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
millimeter of their consciousness." She said, "And so I 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
began to do that, and bit by bit you could feel that their minds were beginning to open up to something else. 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And bit by bit I began to feel like I was getting a little bit of forgetfulness 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
into those minds. 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And when I had reached the point at which I felt they were actually beginning to forget, 

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
then I went on to the second thing. And the second thing was to teach 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
them to work. 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
These were people who didn't know how to do anything, and even if all they could ever learn to do 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
was to keep their own place neat and clean, they had to have something that they could start 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
doing, and then do. And then know that they'd done it. To have some purpose in life. 

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And maybe someday, they would clean someone else's 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
house. They would do something for somebody else, but they would have a purpose,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And they would have a direction and they would have 

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
a focus." She said, "And so I would teach them to work. And then, when I had 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:57.000
taught them those two things -- to forget, and to work -- I would teach them the third thing, which was to perform manicures

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and pedicures." [Laughter]

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So this had all been very emotional up until this point and 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I felt I couldn't burst out 

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
laughing, and I said, 

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
"Manicures and pedicures?" 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
She said, "You know, the worst atrocity of all that was wrought by the Khmer Rouge was that half 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the country turned against the other half of the country. And people who lived through that period knew 

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that they couldn't put any faith in anyone else. And they completely lost the 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
habit 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
of looking anyone else even half in the eye." She said, "And all 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
of these women had been deprived for a long time, at any occasion, 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
to indulge the least bit of personal vanity. I brought them to my hut, 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and I built a special room that I would fill with steam, and it was a pleasure for them to feel beautiful. 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But what was really amazing for them was that, in this context, it was something that 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
was at once 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
very intimate and very impersonal. And they would start because I was telling them how to do it and 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
giving them 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
this instruction to handle each other's fingers and each other's toes. And it meant they were 

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
touching each other. And if I had told them to begin to hold each other's hands or to have some kind 

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
of physical contact with other people, they would have shied away and they would have pulled back. They weren't ready 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to do anything with anyone. But in this context, 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
they would touch each others fingers.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
They would touch each other's toes. And then, because it was such a funny context, and 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
because they felt so happy about the fact that they were, for a moment, feeling a little bit beautiful 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
again, they would begin to laugh together. And they would begin to tell each other little bits 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
of stories and things. And that was the way that I taught them to trust again. 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Because the ability to trust was the biggest thing that they had lost of all." She said, "And when I felt 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that I had really been able to teach them to forget,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and to work and to trust. Then what I tried to say to them was that those

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
were not three separate skills, 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
but three separate parts of a single way of being in the world. And when 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I felt they understood that, then I said to them, 'Now you are ready. Now you are 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
not so depressed. Now you can go into the world 

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
again.'" But what I, afterwards, found out was that many of those women didn't want 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
to go into the world again. They had been so transformed by their exposure to this remarkable, charismatic woman

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and they all said, "But we want to come back here and we want to do more things with you." 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And so what ?Fally Nuon? did was to find that there were many children who were without parents in

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Cambodia at that time and at this

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
time. And she set up an orphanage which is called The Future Light Orphanage in Phnom Penh.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and it's completely staffed by the women who have come through her depression treatment program. And

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
those women volunteer there. They're not paid, but they formed a community. And that

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
community of depressed women, who have worked through their depression, are supported and managed to stave

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
off the recurrence of that depression to some large

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
extent by remaining part of this very tight

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
community. And it's the largest and most successful orphanage that's been established in

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
the wake of the Khmer Rouge. And they care for all of the lost children who there are in Cambodia.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And she remains this small, really rather meek, rather quiet woman. Quiet,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
though she can tell a good story.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
She should come to the next Moth.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Um, this meek, rather quiet woman who just managed

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to figure out, when she was in the camps and stuck with these women who

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
were neglecting their own children, and who were suffering from such severe,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
such crippling, such utterly disabling depression, this is what we have to do to

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
get them to sit up and eventually take care of not only their own children,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but all the children. Thanks.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Applause]
