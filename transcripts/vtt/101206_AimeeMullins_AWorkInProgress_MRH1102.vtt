00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So two weeks ago I was a bridesmaid and the reception was actually here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
at the New York Public Library, and I will never forget this wedding. Yes, it was

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
very beautiful, but, more importantly,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I survived the slick marble floors that are all over this building.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Tile and marble floors are public enemy number one to a stilleto loving girl like

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
me. See when most people learn to walk

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in very high heels, and I had five Inch Nails on that night, they bend their ankle

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so that the ball of the foot touches the ground first, you have more stability. I don't

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
have ankles. So I hit each step on the stilleto, which makes

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the possibility of the banana peel wipe-out very likely.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But given a choice between practicality and theatricality, I say go big or go home and go down

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in flames if you're going to go.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I guess I'm a bit of a daredevil. Um, I think that the nurses

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
at Dupont Institute would agree. I spent a lot of time there as a child.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Doctors amputated both of my legs below the knee when I was an infant, and then, when I was five,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I had a major surgery to correct the wonky direction in which my tibia I was growing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I had two metal pins to hold the full plaster cast on both legs. I had to use a wheelchair because

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I couldn't wear prosthetics. And one of the best things about getting out of a hospital

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
is the anticipation of the day you return to school. You know I had missed so much class, I

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
just couldn't wait to get back and see all my friends, but my teacher had a different idea about that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
She tried to prevent me from returning to class because she said that in the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
condition I was in I was inappropriate, and that I would be a distraction to the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
other students, which of course I was not because of the cast in the wheelchair.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Clearly she needed to make my

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
difference invisible because she wanted to control her environment and make it fit in

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to her idea of

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
what normal looked like. And it was a lot easier for me to fit in to what normal looked

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
like, you know, I

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
wanted that back then.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But instead I had these wooden legs with a rubber foot that the toes broke off of and it was held on with a big, rusty, 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
you know, bolt that rusted out because I swam in the wooden legs and you're not supposed to swim in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
wooden

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
legs, but, you know the wood rots out too, so there you are in second grade

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
music

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
class doing the twist and mid-twist I hear this [splintering noise],

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and I'm on the floor and the lower half of my left leg is in splinters over there and the teacher faints on

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the piano and the kids are screaming, and all I'm thinking is, "My

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
parents are going to kill me. I broke my leg." [laughter] It's a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
mess. But then a few years later my prosthetist tells me, "Amy we got

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
waterproofed legs for you. No more rusty bolts!" I mean this is a revelation for me, this is going to change

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.000
my

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
life. I was so excited to get these

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
legs. Until I saw them. They were made of polypropylene, which is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that white plastic milk jug material. When I say white I'm not talking about skin

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
color, I'm talking about the color white. The skin color

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
was the rubber foam foot painted caucasian. [laughter]

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Which is the nastiest shade of a nuclear peach that you've ever seen in

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
your life. It has nothing to do with any human skin tone on the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
planet, and these legs were so good at being waterproof that they

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
were buoyant.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So when I'd go off the high dive I'd go down and come straight back up, feet first.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They were the bane of my existence. [laughter] But then at the Jersey Shore,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
one summer. You know, by the time we get there there's like 300 yards of towels between me and the sea and I know

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
this is where I first hone my ability to run really fast. I was the white flash.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I didn't want to feel hundreds of pairs of eyes staring at me.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And so, I get myself into the ocean, and you know I was a good swimmer. But no amount of

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
swimming technique, and you know to control buoyant

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
legs. S-so, at some point I get caught in a rip current, and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I'm migrating from my vantage point of where I could see my parents' towel and I'm like, you know,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
taking in water, and I'm fighting fighting fighting all I could think to do was pop off these legs

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and put one under

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
each arm pit with the peach feet sticking up and just bob, like, just wait.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Just, like, someone's gotta find me you know and, and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
a lifeguard did. And

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I'm sure he will collect for therapy bills.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You know, you get the, like, they don't show that on Baywatch. Ugghh. [laughter]

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But they saved my life, those legs, and then I was fourteen at Easter Sunday, and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I was going to be wearing a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
dress that I had purchased with my own money. The first thing I ever bought

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that wasn't on sale.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Momentous event you never forget it. I had a paper route since I was twelve and I went to The Limited

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and I bought this dress that I thought was the height of sophistication. Sleeveless Safari dress, belted,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
hit the knee. Coming downstairs with, in my living room, my father's waiting to take us to church.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
He takes one look at me he says, "That doesn't look right. Go

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
upstairs and change." I was like, "My super

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
classy dress? What are you talking about? It's the best thing I own." And he said, "No, you can see the need join.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
when you walk. Doesn't look right, it's inappropriate to go out like

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that. Go change." And I think something snapped in me.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I refused to change,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and it was the first time I defied my father.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I refused to hide something about myself that was true, and I refused to be

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
embarrassed about something so that other people could feel more comfortable.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And I was grounded for that defiance. And so after church the extended

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
family convenes at my grandmother's house and everybody is complimenting me on how nice I look in this dress. And I'm like,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
"Really? You think I look nice? Cause my parents think I look innapropraite." [laughter] And I outed

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
them. [laughter]

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Kind of mean really. But I think the public utterance of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
this idea that I should somehow hide myself was so shocking to hear that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
it changed their mind

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
about why they were doing it. You know I had

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
always

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
managed to get through life with someone of a positive attitude but I think this was the start

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
of me being able to accept myself. You know OK. I'm not normal. I

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
have strengths, I got weaknesses. I had always been athletic. But it

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
wasn't till college that I started this adventure in track and field. You know I had gone through a lifetime

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
of being given legs that just barely got me by,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and I thought well maybe I'm just having the wrong conversations with the wrong people.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Maybe I need to go find people who say,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
"Yes. We can create anything for you in the space between where your

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
leg ends and the ground."

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And so I started working with engineers, fashion designers, sculptors, hollywood prosthetic

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
makeup artists, wax museum designers to build legs for me. And I

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
decided I wanted to be the fastest woman in the world on artificial legs.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And I was lucky enough to arrive in track at just the right time to be the first person to

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
get these radical sprinting

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah, the fastest thing that

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
runs. Woven carbon fiber, and I was able to set three

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
world records with those legs. And they made no attempt at

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
approximating humanness. But then I got these incredibly lifelike silicone legs, hand

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
painted, capillaries, veins. Hey, I can be as tall as I want to

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
be so I get different legs for different heights. I don't have to shave. My,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I can wear open toed shoes in the winter. And I

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
can

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
most importantly, I can opt out of the cankles I most

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
certainly would have

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
inherited genetically.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So then I get these legs made for me

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
by the late, great Alexander McQueen, and they

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
were hand carved of solid

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
ash with grape vines and magnolias all over them. Six inch heel.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And I was able to walk run ways of the world with supermodels.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And I was suddenly in this whirlwind of adventure and excitement

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and, you know, I was being invited to go around the world and speak about these adventures. And

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
now I had, you know, legs look like glass, legs covered in feathers, porcelain

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
legs, jellyfish legs, all wearable

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
sculpture. And I get this call from a guy who had seen me

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
speak years ago when I was at the beginning of my track career and he says,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
"We loved it, we loved it. We want to you to come back." And it was clear to me, he didn't know all these amazing things

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that had happened to me since my sports career. So as I'm telling him he says,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
"Whoa,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
whoa whoa whoa, hold on, Amy.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The reason everybody liked

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
you, all those years ago is because you were this sweet, vulnerable,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
naive girl,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I'm afraid that if you walk on stage today, and you

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
are this polished young

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
woman, with too many accomplishments," for real. He said

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that. "I'm afraid they won't like you."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Wow. He apparently didn't think I was

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
vulnerable enough now. He was asking me to be less

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
than, a little more

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
downtrodden. He was asking me to disable myself for him and his audience,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and what was so shocking to me about that

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
was I realized I had moved past mere acceptance of

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
my difference. I was having fun with my difference. Thank God I'm not normal.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I get to be extraordinary, and I'll

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
decide what is a weakness and what might be a strength. And so

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I refuse his request.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And a few days later I'm walking in downtown Manhattan at street fair, and I get this tug on my shirt,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and I look down it's of little girl I had met a year earlier when she was at a pivotal moment in her life.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
She had been born with a brittle bone disease that resulted in her left leg being 7

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
centimeters shorter than her right. And she wore a brace and orthopedic shoes,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and they got her by.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But she wanted to do more. And like all Internet

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
savvy kindergartners she gets on the computer and

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Googles new leg. And she comes up with dozens of images

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
of prosthetics, many of them

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
mine. And she prints them out, goes to school, does show and tell on it, comes home

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and makes a startling pronouncement

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
to her parents. "I want to get rid of my bad leg,"

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
she says. "When can I get a new leg?"

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And ultimately that was the decision her parents and doctors made for her. And so here she

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
was 6 months after the amputation, and right there in the middle of the street fair

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
she hikes up her jeans, like, to show me her cool new leg, and

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
it's pink, and it's tattooed with the characters of High School Musical 3.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Replete

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
with red sequin Mary Janes on her feet,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and she was proud of it. She was proud of herself.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And the marvelous thing is that this 6 year old

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
understood something that it took me 20 something years to get.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But we did both

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
discover that when we can celebrate and truly own

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
what it is that makes us different, we're able to find the source of our

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
greatest creative

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
power. Thank you.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Lou.
