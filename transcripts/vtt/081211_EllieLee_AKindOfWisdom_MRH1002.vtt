00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
there

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a kind of wisdom that fathers have. And then there's the kind of wisdom my father has.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Um, for example, when he does things, he thinks he's totally brilliant and I just think

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
he's crazy, you know. For example, when we first immigrated from Hong Kong,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
he thought would be a good idea for all of us to have American names which would, you know, make sense because it would

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
make the transition a lot easier. And so my dad chose the American name

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"Ming" even though, it's like not even his Chinese name. It's just like,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
another Chinese name, it's like a dynasty. You know. So, um,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so when, um, we came over to this country we really had nothing. We were

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
penniless. So in order to save money, my dad thought was a really smart

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
idea to make and design my first winter coat. I was three years

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.000
old, and to this day he thinks it's like the best

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
design. There you go.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Seriously he thinks it's like, "Oh, this is great we should market this."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's the wisdom that my father has. One more example of his wisdom. One day he came

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
home and there was a sale on belts, and he was just like bought a

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
monogramed belt and he was so excited. He's like, "Look at this!" It had

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
this big shiny letter "A" on it. Even though our family name is Lee. And I was like,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
"Dad why did you get a letter A belt that doesn't make any sense." He's like, "Oh I got a letter A because A

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is for

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
ace." Which is. You know like you have to understand something about Chinese people

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Like, Chinese people are obsessed about being number one.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Like, you know. You know, like, "I have a belt now it says so, I'm number one - ace." You know.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And that's something, like, if you never noticed in Chinatowns across the country like, Chinese business people, like, they

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
always have to find 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
find you know the best number one name for their business in order to bring in all the money and the good fortune.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which is why everything's like an imperial dynasty lucky dragon number one kitchen. Like that's the whole

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
mentality. That is my dad. That's his mentality.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So, in the first few years of being in this country you know, he had

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
no time off and worked like crazy and managed to save up a little money to start up his own

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
business. It was a very modest grocery store in Boston's Chinatown.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And of course he called it Ming's Market. But in Chinese the name of it was pìhng ga síh cheùhng,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which literally means, "Cheap Price Market."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And, and it was that, even as a little kid like, I didn't

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
understand. Like literally he told me one day that he would like mark up something by 5

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
cents. You know, like mark up another thing by 10 cents. Like, how are you ever going to make money like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
this? This business model is insane.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
What's the wisdom of that? You know. But you know, strangely enough almost immediately

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
he developed a really loyal following in Boston's Chinatown. Because for the first time

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I think working families and working poor families actually had a place where they could buy affordable,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
healthy, good groceries and eat well. Which is, you know, no small thing when you're poor.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So my dad, after about ten years of having this grocery store, he built it up

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to be a very successful business, and by 1989 he had moved into an enormous space that

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
became New England's largest Asian

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
market. And at the same time that year, I mean you know I was a snotty teenager.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I still thought, "Well, you're crazy. You're a successful businessman, but you're nuts, you know, crazy ideas." And, you know,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
at the same time there is this, he's been running a first floor in this vacant building that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
been vacant for like 20, no, 30

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
years. And the landlord was trying to renovate the other floors to try

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to rent it out as retail space. But he was doing everything on the cheap, so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
instead of hiring a contractor he was like, welding and renovating on his own without pulling permits.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So, one day as you can probably expect, something got out of hand and this big fire broke out as he was welding.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But it was OK. You know they got all the, they evacuated the building about 150

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
people. And the fire trucks arrived immediately and everything was fine, until the fire

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
department hooked up their hoses to the hydrants. And there was no water to fight the fire. And they're like,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"Huh, that's weird." You know. So they went down a couple of 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
blocks and tried the next hydrant. And it was totally dry. What had happened was

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that the city of Boston, a few months prior, they were doing road construction and generally when

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
you drill, if they drill deep they turn off the water pressure, in case they hit a water main.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And when they sealed up the road they forgot to turn the pressure back up. So the firefighters had no tools to fight

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the fire. It was just a disaster. I mean, it was just like an hour later, the building was still on fire

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and there's no water there trying to jerry

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
rig something from a nearby hydrant like, you know, ten blocks

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
away. And if things couldn't get worse the fire jumped an alley

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and the building next door caught on fire. And on the top floor was 10,000 square feet

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of illegally stashed fireworks.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, you know, and so firefighters couldn't scale the ladders on that so there's like. I mean it was a surreal

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
moment 'cause things are exploding, you know, in celebration, you know. Normally you'd have fireworks

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
as my dad stood there and completely helpless watching his life's work just

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
be destroyed in a moment through no fault of his own.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So I got a call. I was a sophomore at the time in college and I went out to the store the next day when

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it was, you know, kind of just like smoldering wasn't on fire anymore and as I made my

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
approach to the store, I remember seeing like three elderly women across the street, and they were crying. And so I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
went up to them and I 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
said, you know, "Is everything OK? Why are you crying?" And lady looked at me. And

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
then she looked at my dad's store, burned-down store. And pointed and

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
teary eyed said, you know, "Where are we going to go now that we don't have a home?"

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And that was kind of like a turning point for me. I hadn't really thought about my dad's

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
store in that way, like you know, I thought it was something he was doing to provide for the family. But

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
in fact he was kind of providing for a Greater Community. He like you

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
know. These elderly women - they didn't have a community center to go to, They didn't have a public park

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
in Chinatown, and this was the only place where they would actually run into their friends and they spent a lot of time there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
In a way it was like a second

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
home. And I guess it is true, it sounds corny, but like you only really

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
do realize what you have when you lose it. And so. In the months that followed I kept

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
begging my dad for more stories. You know. And like one time he told me a story about how

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
a little boy. I asked him–if people–what he did with people who were shoplifters, you know. Because I was really curious and

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
he said, "Well, you know, one

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
day, I caught a kid shoplifting. He was only ten, and

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
he didn't know who I was. I was kind of following him around. He was just like taking stuff, like, stuffing in his bag,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
putting in his pockets.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And at one moment he actually took a break from stealing and sat down

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and started eating the food he had stolen. He was just right in the middle of an aisle." And my dad came up to him,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
he didn't know who he was. He said, "Hey, little boy, have you had enough to

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
eat?" And little boy rubbed his belly like, "Almost." You know.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
My dad's like, "Hey, so where are your parents?" He's like, "Well, they're at work." He's like, "Oh,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
"Oh, why aren't you at home?" He's like, "Because there's no food at home."

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And my dad said, "Well, you know, when you take stuff, specially if it's at a store, and you don't

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
pay for it. It's actually stealing."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And the little boy starts getting really nervous like, "Oh my God. This guy's going to get me in trouble."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You know, and he's kind of angling for a way to get out. And my dad's like, "You know, so in the future, if you don't have

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
anything to eat at home, would you just please just come and find me and ask me for whatever you need?"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
" Like if you ask, I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't steal. Because stealing is wrong."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And in the months that followed, I think my dad really

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
looked forward to seeing the little boy. And it was these stories I was craving and I was asking

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
my dad because in some way I think I was trying to recreate something that I had lost or had kind of 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
you know, taken for granted.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So whenever we went to Chinatown, I remember lots of people would come up to us and say, "Please we need a store like

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
this again. When are you going to open up your store?" And it was hard because my dad was basically kind of penniless.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Like, the fire had

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
caused about 20 million dollars worth of damage. And he barely had enough insurance to cover it. I mean it was like

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
not just inventory,  but like, the bean sprout machine, like the machine that he leased to wash

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and dry beans for. I mean stuff like

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that. And he had no money, but he had this idea that maybe he could pull together what little money he did have

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with a lot of the original employees. People for whom they were, they were immigrants and they got their

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
first jobs through my dad at the 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
store and had been working there since the 70s. So they pulled together. It was a big risk. The only location

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
they could find was just on the outskirts of Chinatown, which in the early 90s, during the last recession,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
it was like a no man's land. It's like this area. Really like. It was so unsafe, and the only reason you would ever

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
go there is to like get a prostitute or drugs. You know. It's like. It was so unsafe. At the time

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I remember in college thinking like what's the wisdom of that? Like why are you going there? It's so unsafe. No one's

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
gonna go. It's just gonna, you know, gonna lose your life savings.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But he did it anyways, because he's crazy. You know. And he, um, almost kind of overnight

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the place was revitalised, you know. There were really loyal people that, families from the

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
suburbs came, and gave patronage to my dad, you know. People walked from Chinatown, and then soon

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
thereafter more and more businesses started popping

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
up. And then there was more and more foot traffic, and then, then families started moving back into the neighborhood,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it was amazing thing, like he kind of helped revitalize this neighborhood to the point that

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
then fifteen years later. It became one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in Boston. Which is why

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
My dad got an eviction notice from the owner.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Because he wanted to kick my dad out and knock down the whole block and build luxury condos. This was a

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
few years ago. So I remember my dad at the time was seventy and I said, "You know, Dad, what do you want to do?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
"Like you have, like ninety employees, and like they're all in their 40s and 50s. You

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
know, they don't speak English. They're kind of, very hard to employ. Like what's going to happen to

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
them?" And I remember at the time my dad said, "You know, you know I'm seventy years

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
old. I'm too old for this." You know, "I'm too old to fight."

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And I understand when my dad says that. But at the time I decided that

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I wasn't too old to fight.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So, I organized the community. And. Sorry.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I organized the community and led this grass roots movement to fight city hall,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and fight one of the largest developers in all of Boston to try to hold ground.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
[cheers, clapping] And at our first public hearing, it was a really amazing turnout. And we got enough press

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that even the mayor changed his tune and started supporting where we were coming from. It was an incredible thing,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
so after the first initial hearing, I remember going to the store afterwards

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and immediately when I walked in there were these two older women who were my dad's employees, and they came, they rushed

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
right up to me and said, "thank you so much for what you did last night! You know, we normally don't think that we

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
have a voice, and we normally don't think we can advocate for ourselves in that kind of way. So thank you

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
for doing what you did."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
did." And when I looked into their eyes I think I felt like the

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
same feeling probably that my dad felt when he saw the boy that once shoplifted or

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
saw the old women outside the store weeping. And when I looked into their eyes I saw

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
so

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
much compassion, and humility, and

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
grace. And it was at that moment that I understood the wisdom that my father had

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
given me. Thank you.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:31.000
(applause)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:31.000
[applause continues]

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
[applause continues]

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
thank.
