00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is a great privilege and a great honor for me

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
because The Moth really exists, because of

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this man.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Because when I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
started, you know, years ago I was in Georgia and I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
was sitting on a porch with my friends and blah, blah, blah, and we had the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
moths zipping around and I thought,  "OK. We're going to

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
have a

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Moth Group

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
here." Somehow I began to think I can bring this to New York.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But I started to get afraid that I might not be able

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to actually present it in New York because in New York people get a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
little antsy about stories. And then

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I saw this movie, My Dinner With Andre, which is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
just -- is it two hours long?  It's just, I don't know how long it is, but it's just a movie

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with nothing but this man telling stories. And it is a riveting,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
fascinating movie. And that was the inspiration we realized we can do this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So I would like to introduce to you the star of that movie and many other

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
movies, and a brilliant director, Andre Gregory.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(applause)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(applause)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Thank you. Thank

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
you for that lovely introduction. Does this go down a bit?  Or should it?  Can you see my face?  My eyes?  Is that alright?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well great. Thank you, thank you very much.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I thought tonight,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I would tell you a story about the first time that I fell deeply,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
deeply in love because everybody here can identify with falling in love.  If

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
my wife Cindy will forgive me because actually every day with her is like the first

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
time.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That's the miracle of it.  The very first time, when I was in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
college, I fell in love with a woman who looked

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
very much like ?Katie? actually.  And I'm not just saying that  -- I'm really not just saying that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so that you won't play the violin.  But

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
she was, she

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
was she was beautiful and tall she was a brunette she was just a little bit different and, uh, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But I think before telling you the story -- her name was Ina -- I think before telling you the story,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I need to tell you so you'll understand the story, just a little bit about my childhood. Now I may

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
have asked this question before, but how many of you have seen "The

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Shining?" Right. Well that was a documentary about my

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
childhood. I'm not kidding. This is true. This is true.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I was never touched, kissed, or hugged. Ever. I kid you not.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I was brought up by nannies, in fact the first nanny I had was a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
German who hated little babies who cried. So she

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
put Seconal in my milk.  And 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
my mother and my grandmother knew very little

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
about children. But after I'd been sleeping for twenty six hours they figured

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that something must be wrong with me. So they took me to the American Hospital in Paris and they pumped my stomach.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And they like to laugh a lot about

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the fact that for about a year afterwards I would kind of, you know, do a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
few steps and then I would just kind of fall down to go to sleep.  And I would

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
always think of my parents, God bless them, sort of as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But you know we've all had difficult parents. And the nice thing really,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but the nice thing about growing older is you learn to forgive

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and to realize that they were just human beings like us and they made their mistakes.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But it's important for this story that you know that I was never touched,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
hugged or kissed,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
right? So I fell in love with Ina.  She was at Radcliffe and I was at

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Harvard and it just never occurred to me that a beautiful,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
really intelligent, wonderful woman could love me, you know.  So we went

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
out to breakfast and lunch and dinner and we went to courses together and we'd go out and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
we'd talk about Schopenhauer

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and Kierkegaard, you know. But I would have never thought of touching

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
her and because you know why would she ever love this sort of strange

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
monster that was

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
me?  And this went on for months. I think she thought I was gay.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And one . . .  I was just madly in love with her, but I would have just never ever

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
thought of touching her.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And one night when we'd been going out for two months but

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
there was never anything romantic about it, we went out to this very beautiful graveyard

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in Marblehead, Massachusetts.  The graveyard was kind of appropriate because her father was the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
largest casket manufacturer in America. That's true, he was -- 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
(Bachmann) Caskets.  And it was a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
beautiful moonlit night and I guess she got so frustrated that she

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
suddenly just grabbed me and quite passionately kissed

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
me.  And I fainted.  

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
This is true. My knees gave way and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I fainted.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And we went out for a couple of

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
months

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
afterwards. It got a little romantic and then, it's a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
sad story because I went to pick her up one night at

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
her dorm and she'd completely disappeared. She never got the nerve to tell me that she was

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
engaged to a Marine captain in

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Korea. And she went home to tell her parents that she wanted to marry me

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and get out of this wedding and her father said You better talk to your mother and her mother

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
said you know we've got the gifts we've got the tent we've got the orchestra -- all girls

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
go through this. Everyone's nervous before a wedding. So she married somebody else.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Now. And I was deeply, deeply depressed. Now,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
the amazing thing about the first time of anything,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
but especially when you fall in love, is

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that there never is anything quite like it because literally twenty

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
five years later,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I was at Elaine's for a New Year's Eve party.  And I'd been

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
married for

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I think twenty or twenty five years. And suddenly, in walked Ina. I

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
know. And my heart started to pound, you know.  And,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and my mouth went dry and I couldn't think of anything to say.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And we sat opposite each other, you know, at this big table with all these people.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And there was music and all night, I kept thinking, "Oh, if only we

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
could have one dance."  You know, I hadn't seen her in twenty five years.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And just as the evening was over she came over and she said to me would you like to

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
dance. And we started to dance. And we started to dance cheek to

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
cheek and at the very end of the dance just very very delicately, she kissed

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
me on the lips, and I

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
fainted.  This

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is true. This is this is really true.  The power

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
of love is an amazing thing.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But there's, I think that

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
there's a lesson to the first time. Because we've all of

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
us experienced an extraordinary first time

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
in something or in many things. Our first creative success.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The first time that we've fallen in love.  The first time we were

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
naked in front of a human

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
being.  The first

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
time is an amazing

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
thing. And it never happens

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
again. When it's happened that first

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
time, it's never quite the same thing again. But the lesson,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the lesson which is

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
a, I think, a deep spiritual lesson, is

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in our lives to try to

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
make every single thing we

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
do, the first time. Every encounter we

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
have, the first time. Every meeting we

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
have, the first time. Every time we see a stop

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
light turn green or turn

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
red, to look at that light with the eyes of a

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
child and the eyes of wonder.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And in that

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
way, from moment to moment and from day to day,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
we can all be in a

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
state of ecstasy, fear,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
wonder and amazement. And

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that is what it is to be

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
truly alive. Thank you. 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(applause)

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
a

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
looney Thank

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you.
