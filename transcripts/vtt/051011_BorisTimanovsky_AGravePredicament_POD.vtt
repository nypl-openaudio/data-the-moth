00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Last summer, after sixteen years of absence,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I went to the city in Russia where I grew

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
up. I went there on company business. And I was bringing with me a suit

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
case filled with secondhand clothes that my

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
mom asked me to distribute among her relatives there. I was really the first

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in my family to go back there after all those years.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And she also gave me a hand-drawn map showing the location of my grandfather's grave

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at a local cemetery, and she asked me to go

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
there. And when I was leaving, she asked me again. 'Are you going to go there?' 'Yes.'

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
'Promise?'

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
'Promise.' It was really important for her that I go there. My grandfather died when I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
was little and, she wanted me to remember him. She would tell me stories

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
about him. I guess it was all a part of dealing with the loss. He was still very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
much alive in her

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
mind. And she wanted him to continue to live in my

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
mind too. But I was just too little when it all happened, so I didn't remember

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
much. So I thought maybe this visit to his grave at the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
cemetery, for her, would make things up; Would

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
make up for what she thought was her loss, her failure in keeping his memory

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
alive. So I promised that the first thing I do when I get there will be go to the cemetery.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Well, the first thing I did when I got there was locate my high school girlfriend.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And I got caught up in work, and I had a lot of catching up to do with my childhood

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
friends. So it wasn't until a day before I was leaving, that I actually found time to go

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to the cemetery. And it was late in the afternoon. And right by the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
entrance was a woman who was selling flowers.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And by then, she only had seven carnations left in her pocket. And I bought them all.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But when I reached for my wallet, I realized I didn't have the map with me. I

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
had no idea what happened to that map, and I had no idea where my grandfather's grave was

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
located. I could call my mom and ask her. There was

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
a payphone right there and I still had ten or fiftenn minutes left on my calling

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
card and it was already morning in New York. But the problem was, I had already told her that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I went to the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
cemetery. And,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
really, you know, what was I gonna say? That I decided to go again but lost the map? She knows who she's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Dealing with, she'd see right through it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So I thought I'd find some help. And I went to look for the main

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
office. And I found the main office and, it was actually in the middle of the cemetery

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and it occupied an actual family mausoleum. So I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
figured some... some affluent family must have immigrate...  must have commissioned it for

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
themselves but then maybe immigrated to the United States, or the management

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
took advantage of the opportunity and moved right

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
in. And, uh, fortunately for me it was open,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and inside was a small office,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
filled with file cabinets. It kind of looked like a financial aid office at some community college.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And behind the counter was an old woman, she was reading. And she said yes she'd help me

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
locate my grandfather's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
records. And she started looking in those file cabinets. And she was doing everything so slowly.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I knew it was going to take forever. And then the back room door opened and the little

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
boy walked in, an eight-year-old, I think.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And he said, 'Grandma. I don't want to play anymore let's go home.' And I could see through

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the door that there was a computer in the back room with Pac-Man or something like that on the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
screen. And she says, 'Do Grandma a favor. Go do a grave

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
identification search, the name is Abraham ?Pikarsky?.' And the boy says, 'Yes. Should

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I look in the mass graves too?' And she turns to me and she says, 'Did you say he died

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in the war?' 'No, he died in the early

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
seventies.' So. The boy went back inside, and a couple of minutes later, he comes

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
back with a printout.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I was gonna reach for it but the boy's grandmother says 'No, no, no, let me see it first, it's five

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
dollars per

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
grave.' And I'd say, 'Well, is there more than one?' She says

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
'Yes, there is always more than one.' So it turned out, there were seventeen

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Abraham ?Pikarskys? on the list. And I paid

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for two.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
The two who died in the early seventies, and

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
whose age, I believe, closely matched my grandfather's.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And I went to look for them. I was hoping that at least one of

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
them would have a portrait on the tombstone. At least it is the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
custom with Russian immigrants here in New York to put portraits on tombstones.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So, I thought, this way I'll know which grave is mine. And I was

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
walking through the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
cemetery, and lots of tombstones have

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
portraits on them, and I was looking at

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the faces. And I was thinking that the faces I saw there didn't look quite

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
as happy as the faces that I see on our Russian tombstones here in Brooklyn.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So I thought that maybe to have immigrated wasn't such a bad thing after all.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Maybe... maybe all those immigrants did find that happiness that they went after.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So I found the first grave and it said Abraham ?Pikarsky? on it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But there was no

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
portrait. It was an inscription from the loving wife and children.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I had no idea whether this was the right one or not, so I went to look for the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
other one.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I found it too, and that one was virtually indistinguishable from the first one.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Even the granite was of the same color. It said Abraham ?Pikarsky?, no portrait,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The inscription was slightly different, it said from the grieving family. So I'd really

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
no idea what to do. Was my family the loving

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
one or the grieving one? I

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
was standing there. And I was... and I was waiting. I was thinking maybe some sort of a

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
special feeling would come to me. I thought maybe I'd feel... I'd feel some sort of

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a kinship with the person who was laying

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
there. But I just... I just kept wondering whether this wasn't a total

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
stranger who was buried there. I tried to remember all

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I knew about my grandfather. He

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
was... He was a locksmith, he was a father of three. One of

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
them died in the war. He was a soccer fan, he died from a heart attack. Who

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
was this Abraham ?Pikarsky??

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
A dentist? An ?oil? accident victim? I

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
really didn't know. I put three carnations on the grave. And I went back to the first one.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I stood there too for a

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
while, and again I was hoping that I'd feel something

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
special, but it was getting late and I remembered that I had yet to

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
pack for the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
trip back to New York, so I put three more carnations, well I put three

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
carnations on this

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
grave. And I stood there with the last flower in my hands, and I

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
didn't really know what to do with that one.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Which Abraham ?Pikarsky? should it go to? Should I just get rid it, should I take a flower from

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
another grave maybe and make sure

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that each Abraham ?Pikarsky? gets the equal number of flowers.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I had to... I couldn't leave. I had to come up with some sort of a formula.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And then suddenly I knew what to do. I put that flower on

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that same grave where I was standing.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I thought if this is really my grandfather who's laying there, then all is well

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
good. And he got the most. But if not, then let this be a

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
consolation to the stranger. Because it wasn't his, but somebody else's grandson, who

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
came all the way from America to pay his respects. And I laughed. I

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
went to the hotel. And I never found that map again.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I flew back to New York the next day. Mom and Dad picked me up at the

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
airport. They have this thing about picking me up at airports. Really.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I would have been home at least an hour sooner, if it wasn't for them. 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
First they couldn't find the parking.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Then they went to look for me at the wrong terminal, then they lost each

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
other... finally, finally I found them.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I found them, and on the way on the way home from the airport, in the car my mom started crying.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And I asked, 'Mom why are you crying? It's only been a week.' And she says, 'I'm just

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
so happy that you took the time to visit your grandfather's grave, it really means so much to me.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I appreciate it. You know when you called and told me you went there, I thought you were

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
just saying it to make me to make me feel good.' But, but this morning, when I was still

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
in the air, her second cousin, who still lives in Russia,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
called

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
her and told her that she had just come from the cemetery and that she saw my flowers there. So

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
my mom really knew that I went there. And she stopped crying and she

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
was sitting there and she was wiping her eyes. And I was thinking, should

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I ask her

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
how

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
many... how many

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
flowers her second

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
cousins saw: three or four?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But then decided that maybe I should just not say anything at all. Thank

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you.
