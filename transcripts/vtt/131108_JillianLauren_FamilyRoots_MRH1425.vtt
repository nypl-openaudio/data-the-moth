 Thank you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So when my husband Scott and I went to Ethiopia, to adopt a baby,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we left a week early in order so that we could travel around and see the land 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
from which we were pulling up our son's roots

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in order to plant them halfway around the globe. And this week was wondrous,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it was transformative but it was also very hard. And was hard not 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
just because of the lack of hot water and 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
other amenities, but I was terrifically anxious. I had been anxious 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for weeks. Because we had recently had a friend go to Russia to adopt a baby and come

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
back empty handed, 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and I was so scared that after all that we had been through, that the rug was

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
going to be pulled out from under us and we were not going to be going home with this baby after all.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I had other worries, which were not as important but still.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Another friend of mine had called me, before we left,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and she said to me "Just prepare yourself because the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
other families in your adoption travel group are probably going to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
be super

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Christian.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I wasn't sure what super Christian meant exactly. But I imagined

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that it probably meant like not believing in evolution and not liking Ozzy

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Ozzy

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Osborne, or Jewish

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
people or something. And I was

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
desperately afraid

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that, that during this, what was probably going to be the most important week of my life, I was going to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
be with these people who were going to judge me.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So I plan my wardrobe and my demeanor very carefully and I decided that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I was going to be somebody respectable. I was not going to be somebody with a naked woman tattooed on

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
my arm and a history to go with it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So I vowed to to cover my tattoos and not to swear like

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Courtney Love like I usually do. And to be relentlessly upbeat.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Like I imagine churchie people to be.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And what I thought about them was that they

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
were going to have really bad haircuts, 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And that they were going to be very friendly, but that they were going to like secretly hate gay people.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I vowed that I was going to grit my teeth and make these people like me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So when we got to the capital city of Addis Ababba and I met the other

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
eight families in our travel group, who we were going to be living with in this big guesthouse for

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the next week, I discovered very quickly that my friend had been both wrong and right.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They weren't all super Christian. There was a handful of arty liberal types, and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
there were a whole bunch of shiny cheeked Christians from the heartland, some of whom

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
had never left Wisconsin a day in their life before they had got on this plane to Africa.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And how we spent the next couple of days was we did our final paperwork and we pace

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the living room jet lagged late into the night and we shared

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
meals. So one morning at breakfast I reached over for the pancakes 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and my sleeves rolled up and showed my tattoos and one of the Wisconsin

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000
moms was sitting next to me, and she was like "Ooooh!"

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I was like, OK here we

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
go. And she said "Ooooh that is so pretty".

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and I was surprised. And I had

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this thought that like, maybe she

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
was different, than what I thought? And then I thought,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Oh, I get it, these people are

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
very tricky.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I'm going to watch out for that.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So this

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is basically how we spent the final few days of what for all of us had

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
been a very long wait to meet our children. And then finally one morning,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
we all got into a bus, and we went to this three story orphanage.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
stucco orphanage behind a tall gate. And we left our shoes at the door. And

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
we walked in and we waited, in this big downstairs living room.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And I sat next to Scott, and I held his hand and I just sat

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
absolutely still. And I thought that if I let one tear fall down my face that I was

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
going collapse into a pile on the floor

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and never get up again. And then they started calling people's names.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And one by one each family went up the stairs. And when they came back down again,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
they had their child in their arms. And they were just holding these babies,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
like they were made of glass, and everyone's face was radiating so much

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
hope and joy and relief

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And there we were watching these families be

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
born. And we were the very last name called. And we went up

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the stairs we followed the social worker into this big room, that was lined

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
with wooden multi-colored cribs and there were blankets strewn all over the floor in

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
these adorable babies rolling

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
around and playing with toys, and in the very middle of the room in this little chair,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
sat my son. ?Taricoo?. I recognized him

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
immediately from the pictures, he has this very wide distinctive forehead

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and, electric chocolate eyes

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And one of the nannies picked him up,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and she handed him to me. And

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
this meltdown. That I had felt on the verge of for months, just

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
dissolved into this primeval calm, the minute I had my baby in my

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
arms. And Scott on the other hand...

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Big tough Scott.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
My former United States Marine husband, was standing next

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to me, weeping.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And ?Taricoo? reached his perfect little hand over and wiped a tear

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
off his father's face

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
face.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And we played with the abies for the rest of that day in the orphanage but we were required to leave them

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
there that night. So I put Taricoo down in his crib, and the crib had

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
a photograph of us taped to the inside that we had been allowed

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to send at Christmas. And I had

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
this overwhelming urge to take him, and run for the door,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and never look back.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Because I was so sure that this miracle that

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
was being dangled in front of us was a cruel joke and it was going to be taken away from us at

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
any minute. But I didn't. I did not kidnap him.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
We left. And the next morning,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
we all boarded a bus and took a four hour drive to the southern

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
region of Ethiopia, to have our entrustment ceremony.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And what an entrustment ceremony is, is it's a chance to

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
meet any living family members of your child, or for some of the children

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to meet the people who had found them and brought them to the steps of the orphanage.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So we went. And when we arrived, I first saw

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
my son's birth mother, through a

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
window in the small room where our meeting was going to take place, she was craning her

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
head around to get a look at us. And we walked in and she ran over and gave us

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
this big warm hug.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And I was surprised that she was so tiny. She was just a teenage, really.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
She had these delicate

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
bird bones. And she wore her hair very neatly braided under a

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
red kerchief. And she smelled really nice. She smelled like, like

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
clothes. And we sat in these three chairs

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
facing each other and a man translated, slowly,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and her answers to our questions were mostly very quiet and short,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
but she lit up a few times. Like she lit up when she told me about

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
?Taricoo? as a baby, and she said "?Taricoo? means his-story

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 and I named him this, because he already

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
has so much history, for such a little boy"

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
boy.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And the interview, it was way too quick,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
but what I took away from it was how kind and how pretty

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and how fiery she had seemed. And how even though she had been

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
unable to care for him she had fought so hard and traveled so far

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to save his life.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And when all of the meetings were over we met in a yellow room that

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
said entrustment ceremony on the wall in English and ?Amharic?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and the birth and the finding families began, and they said a prayer.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And ?Taricoo's? birth mother lit a candle,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and it lit up her beautiful face.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and she handed it to me. And I took it. 

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And then all the adoptive families said a prayer of gratitude.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And in that moment, I really felt like I was a part of this ancient

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and sacred contract, that women have been making with each other since

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
forever, which is that we take care of each

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
other. And when need be, we take care of each other's children.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And when it was over she gave us one last hug and she ducked out the door and out of our lives.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
In the next morning, finally, finally

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
we went and we got our children.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And we took them and we bundle them into the carriers and we went to the embassy to do our

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
final paperwork. And so Scott and I were standing there at the embassy at this window and

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
it looked like a bank teller. And there was this bulletproof glass and behind the

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
bulletproof glass was a

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
man with bloodshot eyes and an unreadable expression and he studied

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
our paperwork for a long time. And then he

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
leaned in and he said, through that little hole in the bulletproof glass,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
he said "You're not eligible to adopt this baby.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
You're only eligible to adopt a baby up to four months old and this baby

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
is eleven months old."

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And he held the paper up to the glass and I

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
saw where the mistake had been made. And I

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
said "No, oh no no no no no no no no that's a typo.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And we are eligible to adopt a baby up to four years old. Up

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
to four years old."

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And he said "No, I'm sorry."

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And he stood up and he left. And

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I waited there for a while holding my sleeping baby on my chest and I was sure

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that he was going to return in any minute like "Ugh,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
sorry. Our mistake. Beautiful baby. Good luck."

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But he didn't. He did not come back and eventually I just started, I started

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
wandering the room like somebody in shock, just asking anyone who would listen

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
to me like "What happened to that guy? Where did that 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
guy go?" And,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we finally went to the waiting room, where all the other families were done. They had gotten

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
through without a hitch, they had their diaper bags packed, plane tickets for the next day, papers signed,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
ready to go.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I told the social worker what had happened and then she left,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
without any explanation about where she was going or when she was coming back.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And at this point I just started sobbing and babbling

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
incomprehensibly

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And all of the families closed ranks

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
around us. And they reassured us

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
us, in ways that only they could have, in the entire

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
world, at that moment. And they were done. They could have

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
left

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
at any time. And they didn't. They stayed with us.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They dug their heels in and our babies played together on these filthy floors with

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
nothing to do. For three hours. And

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
during that time. I sought about how lonely.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Scott and I had felt at home for the last couple of years while we had been going through this adoption 

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
process because it seemed like every other day, some otherwise

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
well meaning friend of ours would make some totally boneheaded comment like "Oh I'm

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
sure that after you

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
guys adopt you're going to be able to get pregnant with a kid of your own." Or,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I even had one former friend who told me,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
who told me that before she was going to schedule

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to schedule a playdate, she would need to see documentation of my kids

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
HIV status.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
status.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And I looked around at the families and I thought I have more in common with each one of

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
these people than I do with most of my friends at home combined.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
combined.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And a few hours later, the social worker came back.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And she walked up to me, and she handed me our paperwork.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And she said "It's all taken care of"

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Very nonchalantly. She said "I don't know what you are so worried 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
about"

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And we

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
all stood, together, and went back to the bus.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But I didn't believe it, I didn't believe it was true, I didn't believe he was truly ours,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Until I was feeding him his bottle,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
when the plane left the ground. And I looked around

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
at the sleeping babies on that plane. And I thought 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
"These people that I judged so harshly because I was so sure that they were going

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to judge me, 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
they're not our friends, they're our

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
family, now". And they still are.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Thank you.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Thank.
