00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I can't make jokes about the

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Holocaust, even though I've noticed that my generation has gotten really good at that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because we have all this distance and supposedly it's our way of neutralizing it. But it's really

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
close to home for me because I was raised by a Holocaust

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
survivor. My grandmother, who lost every living relative in the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
war and was liberated from Bergen Belsen in 1945.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Three years later she came to United States and joined the Satmar Hasidic

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Sect. The Satmar Hacidic Sect believed that the Holocaust had happened

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as a punishment for assimilation and for

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Zionism and that the only way to prevent another one from happening again

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
was for Jewish people to lead a very austere life of deprivation with fanatical

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
adherence to ritual and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
tradition.  That worked for a lot of Holocaust survivors who felt guilty but

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
strangely enough it didn't work for my grandmother. She raised me because my parents arranged marriage

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
had fallen apart when I was very young and my mother had left the community.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Divorce was a tremendous scandal in the Satmar World.  It didn't happen.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And it affected the reputation of our family deeply and because I was

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a reminder of my parents' divorce I was seen as a stain on my family.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I was considered an outcast by my peers.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I spent my childhood feeling...resented as

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if no one wanted me around

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
except my grandmother never made me feel that way. She made

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
me feel loved.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
She made me feel seen. And she made me feel

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
safe. And I clung to her, I spent time with her in her kitchen and I watched as she cooked

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and baked very complicated foods. And I listen to her as she's sang

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Chopin and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Liszt. And I went down with her to the little garden that she kept in the backyard of our Brooklyn

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
brownstone where she grew beautiful pink climbing roses. And she was the source of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
everything that was beautiful and joyful in my life. And she's the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
reason that I am a redeemable human being.  When I was ten

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
years

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
old I went through her lingerie drawer

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because I wanted to find out if she was hiding anything because we never talked and I was so curious about

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
her.  And between her old fashioned silk slips I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
found a spy novel

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In English.  In the Satmar community English books are forbidden,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
As is movies, and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
music, and radio, and newspapers. And I thought,"Wow 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
my grandmother read books." This was huge because at that point.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I had started sneaking out of the community to the Brooklyn public

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
library where I too was reading forbidden secular books. And the moment when I saw that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
spy novel I realized that even though my grandmother and I could never talk about our shared secret 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
it was somehow OK. There wasn't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
anything wrong with me for reading.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
One day I went to the library. And the librarian who knew me at this point, and who knew that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I shouldn't have been there, came over to me, and she didn't say anything because she knew I would have been scared but she gave

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
me a book, and the book was 'The Diary of Anne

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Frank'. I had never heard of Anne Frank.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I thought it was a novel.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I started to read

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
it and I fell in love with Anne.  Because who wouldn't fall in love with Anne? She's wonderful.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Her voice was so full of hope and purity. And she commented

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
on the injustice in the world around her and her hopes and dreams for her future,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
much in the same way I did in my little journals that I kept secret.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And I became very invested in her future. Because it felt like being invested in my own

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
future.  And then Anne went to Bergen

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Belsen. And I stopped. And I realized this was real.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I knew about Bergen Belsen. I didn't know what had happened there but I knew the name. And I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
kept reading and Anne witnessed the most tremendous

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
in humanity and suffering and suddenly I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
realized that that was what my grandmother had endured and witnessed.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then Anne dies, 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and it was like a part of my grandmother had died and I started to cry. And I cried all the way

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
home. And it wasn't regular crying. It was the kind of crying that I can

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
only describe as the crying a child will exhibit when

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
they are dealing with the trauma that they are not equipped to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
process. Because you can't calm down.  You can't

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
stop and so by the time I open the door to our house and I walked in, and I had to go past

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
my grandmother, who is in the kitchen, to my room. I was bawling. And I couldn't breathe.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And of course my grandmother noticed. And she followed me to my room. And she wouldn't let me close the door and she

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
says, '??Mamalo!?? What's wrong? What happened? Why are you crying so

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
hard? And I didn't know what to tell her because I couldn't tell her because I couln't tell her the truth. I couldn't tell her I'd been

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
going to the library because everyone would find out and I would be in trouble.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But I didn't know what excuse to give her because what would be plausible for this reaction. So I lied.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I said I had been on

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the bus and somebody had left a copy of this book, and I picked it up, and it was the Diary of Anne Frank

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and I said '??Bubby?? Now I know what you went through. I know and I don't understand how to make

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
it OK. I don't unders--I don't know how to stop crying. I don't know how to keep living please tell

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
me something that will make it

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
OK. Because I don't,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I don't know how to

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
live with this knowledge that this is what you went through.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And she turned white, and she shut the door,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and she didn't answer me.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And we never talked about it again.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
When I was 22 years old I left the Satmar Hacidic Sect because it was a place

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
where I felt confined and I couldn't be

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
myself. I had to cut ties with everyone I ever knew

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
including my grandmother who is the most precious thing that I have

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
lost. But that question I asked her so many years

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
ago that was never answered stuck with me. And it became much more urgent all

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
of a sudden as I had started over from scratch

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
not knowing where my new home would be, or what kind of person I would be in the future, I needed to

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
understand how she had been through something like this on a much grander scale and how she

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
had endured. So I embarked on the trip.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I was going to go to Europe. And I was going to retrace her entire journey from the place where she

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
was born until the port that she sailed to America from. And I

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
did that. And I started in Hungary. And I worked my way along the concentration camp

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
trail.  And on the way I met a lot of Germans.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And I remembered that the one belief about the Satmar Community that my grandmother had ascribed to

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
was that all Germans were

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
evil. And that secretly, even if they pretended to be nice to you, they wanted

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
to kill me because I was Jewish.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So I decided to test that theory.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I would walk up to German people and in a very hostile aggressive way I would ask

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
them these probing questions about their ancestry. "What did your grandparents do during the war?"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
"Are you an

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
anti-Semite?" Invariably all of

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
their grandparents were in the resistance. None of them knew any

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
anti-Semite. 'This is fishy,' I thought.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Then I met Marcus, in a bar in Munich and I asked him what did

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
your grandparents do during the war, were they in the resistance

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
too? Actually he said, 'My grandfather was in the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
SS. I remember my grandmother used to brag about kissing Hitler's

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
hand.' And I was not prepared for someone to say

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
'Yes'. And we talked. And suddenly I realized that he was very handsome.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
In a typical Arian

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
way. And he was smart and his German accent--

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
it sounds so awful to say this--but it was really sexy.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And he looked at me and he said,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
'I didn't know people like you were real! I thought you were just in Woody Allen

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
movies.' And this was before the Woody Allen scandal so I was only a little

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
bit

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
insulted. But anyway. An

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
hour later we fell into bed. And we stayed there for six hours. And

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
then he traveled with me to the concentration

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
camps. I went to Bergen

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Belsen.  At Bergen Belsen I saw a photograph. It

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.000
was

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
a photograph that the B.B.C. had taken upon liberation and there were

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
piles of corpses in the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
photograph and women sitting up amongst the corpses,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
these indescribable expression on their faces. And I looked at

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the photo when it was blown up in front of me and I realized, 'my grandmother was

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
there. She saw that!' And I became

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
filled with a tremendous, explosive rage.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I was so angry. I wanted to murder somebody.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And of course the best person to take all my anger out on was: Marcus.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Marcus

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
he, he took it though, he wouldn't abandon me.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And we went on with our trip from Holocaust site to holocaust site.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And somehow we just couldn't separate and then at the end of our itineray he said to

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
me  "Do you want to meet my mother?"

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And I thought. The man I'm dating wants me to meet his mother?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then I thought. The man I'm dating wanted me to meet his mother who was raised by Nazi's.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And I said yes and we went to

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Frankfurt. And I was very nervous and I practice my greeting in German which is really complicated because

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
they don't just say. Nice to meet you. They have a long series of verbs one after the other that

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
basically translates to it's nice to get to learn to know you. And I practice and practice which

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
verb came first and of course I knock on the door and she opened and I said it all backwards.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
But it's fine. She was nervous too. And I got into her apartment. And it was

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
beautiful and immaculate. And it was, there were knick knacks everywhere. My grandmother would have

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
called them tchotchke's. And she took me out to her garden.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And in her garden. There were beautiful pink climbing roses. Just like

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
the ones my grandmother had

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
grown. And I looked around at her place and I looked at her and I looked at her garden I

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
thought. I think they would have liked each other. My grandmother and this woman.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Except for the German thing. And then we sat down on her terrace

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and we talked. And I asked her about it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I said "How are you different?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
How is it that you were raised by these people, and you're not this way." And she

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
said "It's a good question. My parents were racist until their dying

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
day. But you have to understand I was part of a generation that wanted nothing to do with

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that. Everyone around me was rebelling. And I'm not special. It was just something that we didn't want to be

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
a part of." And she looked very sad and I and I asked her "what's wrong? Why why

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
are you so sad?" and she said "You're the first Jew I've ever met.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I've never had to really think about what my parents had done or what kind

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
of impact

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
their actions had had in the lives of others. But now that you're here I have to think

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
about that."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And I said "no, that's not why I'm here, that's not what I want. I want to let go of all that. I don't want this,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
this hate and this, and this trauma to last forever. I'm here to let go

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
of that. I want to escape that. And it, it's okay, I just want my life to be filled with love and

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
forgiveness." and she looked at me and she said

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
"It's easy for the victims to say they forgive.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
The guilty cannot forgive themselves."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And I didn't know if I believed myself.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I didn't know if I believed her either

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
when we talked about

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that. But we wrapped up the trip. And I went home. And

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I stopped thinking about the Holocaust twenty four seven. Marcus came to visit me

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
in the States. And we weren't going to concentration camps we were going to farmers markets.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and he was normal. We were just a couple and,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I thought I was in love and that this was going to

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
work. And then one day, as he was leaving for the airport he asked to borrow

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
a book for the plane ride home. And I surveyed my bookshelves. And I thought what could

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I give him that I really

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
like. And then I found something and I pulled it from the shelf and it was Nathan Englanders collection of

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
short stories titled. 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Frank.' And I gave it to him. And a few days later we Skype and I said What did you think

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
of the book.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And he said. I'll be frank with you. It's a bit

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Jew overload for me. And I said honey.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Nathan Englander is Jew overload for you but you're dating me.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And I thought I had given up so much. In my life. To be free,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
to be one hundred percent me.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And I really needed to live a life where I could talk about Anne Frank.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Thank you.
